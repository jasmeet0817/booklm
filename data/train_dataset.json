Authorization zero-zero-six, Suriel.\u201d\nThere came an almost-audible hiss from Ozriel\u2019s black-armored form as the restrictions on his power fell away. He tossed white hair behind him and gave a relieved sigh. \u201cAh, that\u2019s nice.\u201d\nHis authority radiated in all directions, including deeper. It filled the Iteration and spilled into the Way, silent and invisible. The footsteps of Death.\nOzriel stretched out a hand to the side. \u201cCome to me,\u201d he murmured.\nThat call echoed through all creation.\nAt least, it should have.\n[The Sector is fully isolated,] Suriel\u2019s Presence reported.\n\u201cAs expected,\u201d Ozriel responded. \u201cBut if it\u2019s worth trying, isn\u2019t it worth trying twice?\u201d\nThe world of Vesper was trembling around them, and Suriel brought forth her Razor. \u201cHe\u2019s almost here. Can you beat him?\u201d\nOzriel had his eyes closed and hand still stretched out as he prepared another working, but he still addressed her. \u201cDidn\u2019t your Presence tell you? We have about a one in sixteen chance of both making it out.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust that.\u201d\nHer Presence radiated shock.\nHe still didn\u2019t open his eyes, but his answering grin was a small slice of white. \u201cYour faith in me is inspiring. I would be more confident if he were actually alone, because I see now that he is not. Or\u2026if I were armed.\u201d\nColor and sound bled from the planet beneath them as Ozriel\u2019s eyes snapped open. \u201cCome to me,\u201d he ordered again.\nIteration Three Hundred trembled.\nThe Way trembled.\nThe entire Sector trembled.\nBut the Reaper\u2019s hand remained empty. The Scythe of Ozriel did not appear.\nHe sighed and put his hand down. \u201cYeah. One in sixteen.\u201d\nReality crumpled and tore. The void of space parted like a curtain to reveal the Void beyond.\n\u201cBetter odds than you deserve,\u201d the Mad King said.\nTo all Suriel\u2019s senses, Daruman appeared no worse for his battle in Cradle. His armor of yellowed bone was still chipped in places, but it protected him. The beast hide hanging from his shoulders offended the universe with its chaotic authority, and his eyes burned like two red suns.\nIf he were alone, Suriel would like their chances. But as expected, he had come prepared for another clash with Ozriel.\nBehind him, a vast mass of stone and metal slid out of the Void. It dwarfed the central planet of Vesper, casting a shadow over its continents.\nThe fortress-world of Tal\u2019gullour. The Mad King\u2019s citadel.\nBillions of souls pulled the Way closer, strengthening Suriel\u2019s authority. Vesper was healthier now than it had been in years.\nBut however much it strengthened the Abidan, it empowered Daruman more. He was the absolute power in Tal\u2019gullour, its master and champion, and its every particle was saturated with his authority.\nA thousand rune-circles appeared in front of the fortress, each shining in golden light. These were ancient defenses, operated by the people of Tal\u2019gullour, and they locked the fortress down tight. Even Ozriel couldn\u2019t break them in one strike. At least, not without his Scythe.\nThe Mad King had brought his people here. Dedicated to the destruction of the Abidan he may have been, but he did love that world. He was truly putting everything on the line.\nSuriel could do no less.\nOur survival is no longer a priority, she ordered her Presence. Prioritize the death of the Mad King.\nSuriel had to rearrange her own feelings at the same time. She released her sadness, her fear. Her anger at Makiel, for leaving them in this situation. Even her lingering resentment toward Ozriel.\nShe was the Phoenix. It was worth her life to burn one more infection from the universe.\nThe Mad King\u2019s sword appeared in his hand. \u201cLet us die together.\u201d\nSuriel held up her Razor. \u201cEverything ends.\u201d\n\u201cAhem.\u201d Ozriel\u2019s voice echoed in her head. \u201cI may have an alternate plan.\u201d\nHis plan flooded into her mind, and she snapped her gaze to look at Ozriel in shock.\n[It has good odds of working,] her Presence allowed.\nSuriel\u2019s very being rejected the plan.", "bb332175-56a1-45c5-b89d-5aead683ec8f": "Suriel could do no less.\nOur survival is no longer a priority, she ordered her Presence.

The odds of them both surviving were terrible. But the odds of one surviving? Quite high.\nAs long as they gave up on the other.\nHeart breaking, Suriel agreed.\nWith her Razor unleashed, she struck, but not at the Mad King. At the thin membrane of reality between her and the Way.\nThe Way Between Worlds was closer than ever, thanks to the population of Tal\u2019gullour, but it had also locked down space. Her Razor stuck in place.\nUntil Ozriel formed a blade of dark power and slashed alongside her. Then, for a fraction of a second, she saw blue.\nSuriel slipped away in that instant. The possibilities were clear in her vision: if they both tried to leave, the Mad King would drag them back.\nInstead, she made it into the rich blue river of the Way.\nIt dragged her into its currents, but she was far from safe. Her Presence warned her of the barriers and obstacles the Mad King had left in the Way. He\u2019d sealed off the Sector, stopping her from running for help.\nBut her odds of breaking through were much better than her odds of surviving a battle in Vesper. Now, it was all about how quickly she could make it back.\n[You can\u2019t\u2014] her Presence began.\nShut up.\nDozens of tendrils erupted from all around her as a Fiend reached into the Way to grab her. It was quite powerful, having been left as a sentry to hold her back.\nBut Suriel had no time to waste. She cut her way through, counting every second.\nShe might already be too late.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nBack in Vesper, Ozriel pointed at the Mad King with his conjured black sword. \u201cI thought you\u2019d fight harder to stop her.\u201d\n\u201cSuriel would eventually be replaced,\u201d Daruman responded. \u201cHow will they replace you?\u201d\nOzriel didn\u2019t have his Presence with him, but he could see the potential outcomes well enough. His odds of walking out of here were\u2026small.\nStill, he gave the Mad King a brilliant smile. \u201cI have some ideas on that myself.\u201d\nThen a thousand lines of light streaked out from Tal\u2019gullour, a barrage that instantly shattered the central planet of Vesper and raced for Ozriel.\nAnd he began his final battle.", "f01c528d-91b6-4043-8fa7-5e346051be90": "1\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sky inside Lindon\u2019s repurposed pocket world was overcast by slowly swirling clouds of various colors. While the heart of the space had been stolen from Reigan Shen, much of its material had come from the Ninecloud Court, and their influence was clear in the churning rainbow vapor that shone brightly overhead.\nThe wind that stirred those clouds only began when Lindon stepped inside. While empty, the time in the pocket space had been slowed to a crawl. Almost frozen. It would have been too much of a waste to spend their limited time while no one was here to benefit.\nWith Lindon\u2019s appearance, time moved forward again.\nUpon entering the space, Lindon first checked its spatial stability by extending his senses. The Void Icon told him that he was boarding a small vessel drifting in the middle of a sea of nonexistence, as though they\u2019d stepped off a dock and onto a boat, but everything seemed stable.\nIt felt like it would hold, and in the meantime, they would pass weeks in a matter of hours. That level of time acceleration would strain the pocket world, and was an inefficient use of the materials, but economy didn\u2019t concern Lindon much.\nIt was worth burning a fortune for speed. It wasn\u2019t Lindon\u2019s fortune anyway.\nOnly once he was sure their shelter wouldn\u2019t capsize into the Void did Lindon turn his attention to the layout of the space itself. Beneath the sky of slowly mixing colors floated a rough island of pale stone maybe a mile across.\nIt reminded Lindon of the slabs of marble from which Reigan Shen had once built his Monarch platform at the Uncrowned King tournament. Which made sense, as he had stolen this island from Shen. Tunnels wound through the stone, containing several facilities and aura training rooms that Lindon dismissed after a single scan.\nHis would be better.\nYerin entered the pocket world at virtually the same time he did. She glanced into his arms, where Lindon held Mercy\u2019s unconscious body.\nSince leaving the Akura clan, he hadn\u2019t let her out of his sight.\nOrthos, Ziel, and Little Blue were supposed to follow only a fraction of a second later, but the world on their side looked almost frozen now that time was speeding up. They were all crammed into the hallway of Windfall, ready to enter as soon as they could.\nThey spilled through a few moments later, Orthos grumbling as he had to turn sideways and slide himself through the doorway. Lindon and Yerin had already walked away.\nYerin chewed on her lip and her worried eyes stayed on Mercy. \u201cShe\u2019s all shredded up.\u201d\n[No, don\u2019t worry!] Dross encouraged her. [It\u2019s just severe structural damage to the madra channels. She\u2019ll be fine in a few years.]\n\u201cBut we have a plan,\u201d Lindon added. He activated the Soulforge, and a gateway appeared within the pocket world. It looked out onto another space, a rune-carved platform floating over a starry void. A dull silver altar sat in the middle of the platform, bright blue flames flickering merrily at its heart.\nLindon\u2019s void key strained under the pressure from the artifacts he\u2019d stolen from the Monarchs. He floated them out in sealed containers, and the Soulforge trembled under the weight of their significance.\nFortunately, the Soulforge kept that power isolated from the rest of the space.\n\u201cThe Monarchs had to work together to stabilize your spirit so you didn\u2019t have to face any consequences from advancing early,\u201d Lindon said to Yerin. He carefully floated Mercy over using wind aura, then rested her on the surface of the anvil at the heart of the Soulforge. \u201cWe\u2019re going to borrow their authority to do the same thing here.\u201d\n[Technically not the same thing. And they didn\u2019t need all the Monarchs, just enough to cover a wide enough variety of authority.

He slipped on a signet ring belonging to Reigan Shen, lifted a scepter belonging to an ancient Monarch whose name had been lost to time, and replaced his outer robe with a shoddy one that Northstrider had owned for years.\nAlso, from his soulspace, he brought a single blue-green leaf with an eye in the center.\nThe authority embedded in the objects had a specific purpose. The power struggled against Lindon as he tried to focus it, to bend it to his will.\nReigan Shen\u2019s represented his wealth and his command over space, while Northstrider\u2019s authority was much more physical. The scepter shone with the purity of a wandering monk, a sacred artist who gave up all worldly causes.\nLindon not only had to wrangle all that authority to one purpose but had to link it to his own authority. He found the Void Icon and focused his attention, trying to restore Mercy\u2019s condition to before. To use Void authority for such a task, he had to think of it as reducing her wounds to nothing. To negate the specific events that had left her that way.\nThough he was already wrestling with too much power, he needed more. Healing her wasn\u2019t enough; he had to rebuild her foundation. He clasped Suriel\u2019s marble in his left hand. It didn\u2019t lend him any power, but its restorative aura could guide him.\nYerin eyed him up and down. \u201cYou look like a vagrant wanderer trying to dress up rich.\u201d\n[Don\u2019t worry,] Dross said. [I won\u2019t let it go to his head.]\nA crown settled on Lindon\u2019s brow. It was the legacy of another ancient Monarch, and this one Lindon hadn\u2019t stolen; he\u2019d found it in the labyrinth.\nLindon\u2019s mind and spirit trembled as he tried to juggle all the authority, but his voice was clear as he commanded Mercy: \u201cBe whole.\u201d\nThe result wasn\u2019t as simple as Lindon had hoped.\nEach source of authority tried to restore Mercy in a different way. Unlike a living person, the items were inflexible and bound to a specific purpose. They fought one another and resisted Lindon.\nBut his command touched something deeper, something that ran beneath reality. A force that reminded him of Suriel, and of the chambers at the very bottom of reality. That distant force echoed.\nA spark of blue light flickered through Mercy, and Lindon fell to his knees.\nHe felt like he\u2019d tumbled down a waterfall in less than a second. This was the force that held reality in place, the power that he\u2019d only heard whispers of: The Way Between Worlds. The power of pure order.\nIt was too much to command such power directly. He had stretched himself.\nBut it worked.\nMercy sat up straight on the anvil at the heart of the Soulforge, gasping for air. Purple eyes shot here and there in obvious confusion, and her breaths were harsh.\nYerin stood over her in concern, hands on Mercy\u2019s shoulders. \u201cMercy. Oi. Look me in the eyes. Can you see straight?\u201d\nClarity returned to Mercy\u2019s gaze. She looked from Yerin to Lindon, and Lindon saw the memory hit her. Then tears welled up and she threw her arms around Yerin and began to sob.\nThe only phrase Lindon caught was \u201cmy mother.\u201d He wasn\u2019t sure the rest were even words. Yerin softened and held Mercy as she cried.\nLindon wanted to speak his own assurances, but the world was unsteady around him. The scepter in his left hand cracked and a fragment of cloth drifted down from Northstrider\u2019s robe. All the items felt strained, with the notable exception of Emriss Silentborn\u2019s leaf.

That was ripe with healing authority, so it had channeled his commands easily.\n[I did warn you this was a possibility,] Dross pointed out. [We\u2019re not working with living Monarchs, are we?]\nLindon responded silently. These aren\u2019t simple constructs. They\u2019re not supposed to be disposable.\n[They\u2019re not supposed to be used by anyone other than their creators. Borrowing their authority even once was an achievement. We should celebrate! Woohoo, you did it! You\u2019re not celebrating.]\nLindon was focused on the scepter. He could fix the physical damage to the item easily enough, but it was the symptom of a deeper problem. In the worst case, we might need to use these four more times.\n[How do you feel about once more?]\nLindon cast his mind through other options. Emriss Silentborn would cooperate with them, and if it came to restoring spirits, there was likely no Monarch better. But bracing a spirit to speed through several advancement levels was harder, and it was too much to ask for more than one Monarch to help.\nIn theory, he could get new objects of power. There was plenty of the labyrinth he hadn\u2019t explored yet, and he could still use its transportation power to steal more from the Monarchs.\nIn practice, they didn\u2019t have the time for that.\n[We haven\u2019t managed to open everything we stole yet,] Dross encouraged him. [I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get everyone up to standard in time.]\nEven inside a pocket world that ran a hundred times faster, time was their limiting factor. But there were other possible solutions.\nWe\u2019ll continue as we are, Lindon thought. I\u2019ll work on it.\n[Oh, good. I was worried I was going to have to work on it.]\nYou already have a job. Lindon felt Dross\u2019 mind flash with thoughts of twisting dreams and white halos before Dross sighed and agreed.\nMercy wiped the mess off her face with the backs of her black-gloved hands as she sniffled. She looked to Lindon. \u201cThanks. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have\u2026\u201d\nShe trailed off. Lindon inclined his head to her. \u201cWe were never going to leave you behind,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I do regret that we had to fight your mother.\u201d\nMercy sagged back down against the altar. \u201cYou should ascend. She won\u2019t let you go anymore.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019d better ask us to let her go,\u201d Yerin muttered.\nLindon scanned Mercy\u2019s spirit, drawing her attention to her own condition. \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to ascend yourself soon.\u201d\nShe smiled sadly. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure I will. I\u2019ll be right behind\u2026\u201d Mercy froze with her mouth open as she checked her spirit.\nAn instant later, the Book of Eternal Night manifested over her head. It was larger and brighter than ever before. More distinct. Its connection to her spirit had improved, thanks to her forcing open the seventh page.\nNormally, that would be more burden than she could handle. Instead of an advantage, it would be a crippling weight that settled on her spirit.\nBut now, the authority of Monarchs had reinforced her soul.

Especially compared to the wounded, unbalanced soul he\u2019d possessed for most of the time Lindon had known him.\nNot only was his spirit more stable than Lindon had ever felt it, but there was a curious depth to it that Lindon knew to be the first few wisps of vague authority.\nZiel had begun to resonate with an Icon, as Lindon had sensed before, though it was hard to tell which one.\n\u201cNot a Herald,\u201d Yerin assured Mercy. \u201cBut Lindon\u2019s not explaining it, so I\u2019ll take a swing at it: the Book tore you up on the inside. He borrowed some Monarch tools to fix you, which left you more stable than ever.\u201d She turned to Lindon. \u201cHow\u2019d I do?\u201d\n\u201cExactly right.\u201d\nDross manifested over Lindon\u2019s shoulder. [He\u2019s being generous. You missed a lot of nuance and effort. Mostly on my part.]\n\u201cGlad you made it,\u201d Ziel said. His voice was flat as ever.\nMercy teared up again. \u201cThank you, Ziel! I just\u2026I need some time to\u2026\u201d\nShe started crying again. Ziel coughed and slid slowly back out of sight.\nYerin took Mercy underground to the few half-finished caves that were the only shelter currently on the island. Lindon stayed behind with Ziel, Orthos, and Little Blue. They stood on bare marble, looking up into the color-swirling sky as a dry wind swept dust past them.\nLittle Blue whistled a question.\n[That\u2019s the fun part!] Dross answered excitedly. [Now Lindon gets to create a world.]\nWorry for Mercy had been eating at Lindon\u2019s thoughts, not to mention that he had just fought a Monarch.\nBut he had been looking forward to this.\nZiel eyed him skeptically. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you rest before you try something like this?\u201d\nLindon adjusted his sleeves. \u201cIf I don\u2019t feel like I can handle it, I\u2019ll stop. Would you all open your void keys, please?\u201d\nZiel shrugged and obeyed. A door opened in the air next to him. Orthos was next, and even Little Blue, though she only activated one that Orthos had carried for her.\nEven through all the scripted containers and restrictions Lindon had placed, power radiated out of the keys. Space trembled gently, though Lindon was encouraged that the pocket world remained stable.\nHe didn\u2019t have a single void key big or strong enough to contain everything he\u2019d stolen from the Monarchs.\nThat thought cheered him greatly.\nOrthos faced his own void key. \u201cTell me where to start.\u201d\nLindon reached out with soulfire. In his Copper sight, wind aura was a strong, vivid green here.\nWith fingers of wind, Lindon seized a chest from Orthos\u2019 void key and brought it out. At the same time, his soulfire resonated with the yellow veins of earth aura beneath his feet.\nGuided by vital aura, the marble on the edge of the island flowed up into another cave entrance. The cave continued beneath the surface, though it wasn\u2019t deep.\n\u201cI\u2019ll make our cycling room first, Orthos,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have as much space as I\u2019d like, but it will be big enough for the two of us.\u201d\nOrthos watched Lindon use complex Ruler techniques effortlessly, even without a compatible Path, and snorted smoke. Lindon felt a spark of the turtle\u2019s jealousy and smiled slightly.\nBefore long, Orthos would be able to do this himself.\nOrthos scanned around the marble ground, looking for something, so Lindon diverted a little earth aura to create some pebbles for him to snack on.\n[It\u2019s rare for any sacred artist to be able to cycle with ultimate natural treasures,] Dross said.

He manifested next to Lindon, looking proud. [Let\u2019s all thank the Monarchs for financing our operation.]\nLittle Blue applauded.\nThe first chest from Orthos\u2019 void key opened, and suddenly the temperature in the entire pocket world rose several degrees. Red-gold light spilled out, and all the fire aura Lindon could see strengthened visibly as he lifted out the Heaven\u2019s Torch.\nIt looked almost like a miniature, reddish sun, and manipulating it with wind caused the aura to become infected with heat. Gusts of flame blew away, and without Lindon\u2019s control, fires would have started all over the island.\nHe drifted the natural treasure into the cave and Ziel squared his shoulders. \u201cI\u2019ll handle the containment script,\u201d he said, so Lindon stopped etching it into the surface.\n\u201cOh, gratitude.\u201d\nZiel stared at him. \u201cYou were doing it yourself, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d rather leave it to the expert.\u201d In truth, Lindon was very practiced with the Blackflame containment script, but Ziel would save him some time. At least a minute or two.\nZiel trudged off, appearing even less eager than usual.\nAfter the Heaven\u2019s Torch came a heavily scripted tank. Lindon couldn\u2019t manipulate this treasure directly, as even the incidental effects of aura exposure might cause a disaster. It resembled a fist-sized droplet of gray liquid, shifting under its own power.\nAlthough gray wasn\u2019t the perfect way to describe it. On closer inspection, neither was liquid.\nIt was a flickering, buzzing gray that looked like the world hadn\u2019t made up its mind what color it should be. And it shifted and twitched in place like it was made of ten million tiny insects.\nLittle Blue shuddered back from it, while Orthos gave a gasp.\n\u201cVoid Matter,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cThe ultimate treasure of destruction aura.\u201d\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d see it with my own eyes,\u201d Orthos said.\n\u201cYou can thank Reigan Shen.\u201d\nLindon placed the tank containing the natural treasure inside the cave, close to the Heaven\u2019s Torch. But not too close. He would have to rearrange them manually for perfect balance, but first he could at least get the treasures in the same room.\nLindon turned his attention to another location and began to raise a second cave entrance.\nInto Yerin\u2019s training room, Lindon placed a Blade Crystal, a paper-thin jewel that he had to hold gingerly with aura. One of the forms of ultimate sword treasure, the Crystal was so sharp that it was better used for training than actual combat.\nShe would balance that out with the Heart\u2019s Gem she already possessed, so he moved on to Mercy\u2019s training room. That he filled with a drop of Abyssal Ink, which rejected all light. He had to wait until Ziel finished the containment script for that one first, or it would have darkened the entire pocket world.\nOnce that cave was hidden with a darkness so impenetrable it twisted the eye, Ziel stood up from where he had been etching script into the stone.\n\u201cI know you\u2019re about to surprise me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m saying anything. But if you couldn\u2019t find a force treasure, I don\u2019t blame\u2014\u201d\nLindon floated a box out of Little Blue\u2019s void key.\nThis one had been relatively easy to transport, compared to the others. He opened the box and delicately lifted a head-sized ball of what seemed to be bronze. \u201cThe Sovereign Drum. As you know, force treasures rarely form naturally. This one was made by sacred artists before the Dread War.\u201d\nZiel took it with precise care and carried it into the cycling room himself. Lindon was relieved. His own force control was rudimentary compared to Ziel\u2019s, and an accidental strike of the Sovereign Drum could release enough power to blow the island apart.\n\u201cThe Monarchs must hate you,\u201d Ziel said.\n\u201cThey do,\u201d Lindon replied.", "3a8ac153-7cba-47fa-ad05-7b84151b547a": "\u201cI know you\u2019re about to surprise me,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I\u2019m saying anything.

He reinforced it with rare metals and powerful scripts, and he would continue reinforcing it over the coming days. Ideally, he would have an entire separate space for that, as the hall was very small considering the scale of Monarch techniques.\nBut he was confident he could get it to withstand Monarch-level power.\nAfter that, he raised up a more attractive building and separated it into rooms. Orthos and Little Blue began carrying furniture inside; he had hated to take up valuable void key space with things that had no spiritual power, but they had to rest somewhere.\nFinally, Lindon only had one stretch of the marble island left to work with. He raised pale stone into a long, narrow building with eight rooms, like a stable made to hold exactly eight horses.\nZiel walked up as though to begin working on another script, but hesitated. \u201cWho is this for?\u201d\n\u201cAll of us,\u201d Lindon said.\n[If it works,] Dross put in. [And this one really might not.] He drifted away from Lindon, carrying a simple construct carefully. The construct shone strange colors, radiating the power of corrupted dreams.\nIt had been made from a piece of the Silent King\u2019s halo.\nDross placed the construct into the center of the leftmost room and fled, reappearing over Lindon\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t going to activate it?\u201d Lindon asked.\n[I\u2019m looking forward to it, I really am. Oh, I can\u2019t wait! But maybe you do it.]\n\u201cIt won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d\n[We don\u2019t know what it will do.]\nThat might be true. Lindon was painfully ignorant of the forces he was about to invoke. But he needed to learn.\nWith a pulse of pure madra, Lindon activated the construct.\nAn illusion filled the room. It was the image of another cave, one made of dark blue-black stone. A hollow that had been carved into the very foundation of the labyrinth.\nIt was filled with flickering images. Lindon looked into it and saw a kind of mirror; himself as an Unsouled, himself with no Dreadgod arm dying of old age, his parents as children, Yerin fighting Malice with her sword-arms black instead of red.\nPast, present, and future flickered in a headache-inducing collage. A symbol over the top of the cave resembled some kind of abstract animal head surrounding what Lindon thought was an eye.\nThis illusionary recreation was much weaker than the real thing, but it still radiated authority that felt related to dream aura, but deeper. As though it were greater than dreams.\nZiel winced and held up a hand. Lindon was feeling the same way.\n\u201cWe put together my memory, Dross\u2019 memory, and captured images with constructs. Even so, this is a poor rendition of the original. It is too profound for us to understand.\u201d\n\u201cProbably for the best,\u201d Ziel said. He tried to glimpse the cavern again and had to blink back tears. \u201cIf I have to study a tiger, I\u2019d rather have a picture than the real thing.\u201d\nNext to Lindon, Orthos and Little Blue quivered.\n\u201cWhat are these?\u201d Orthos asked.\n[The Paths of Heaven,] Dross responded, and for once he sounded completely serious.\nLindon deactivated the construct, and everyone gave a sigh of relief. He had similar constructs prepared for all eight, and he prepared to embed them into the floor of the chambers. As he did, he kept glancing at the eighth.\nSince the illusion construct wasn\u2019t active, the eighth opening only looked like an empty marble room, but this would be the dark one.

Only yesterday, you were a Jade quaking beneath my footsteps.\u201d\nZiel sighed. \u201cWe\u2019re well-stocked, I\u2019ll say that for us. If we\u2019re going to do the impossible, at least we have the facilities for it.\u201d\nLindon looked over the island, now filled with marble buildings he\u2019d grown, and felt a pleasant swell of pride. There was more to do, but this was a good start.\nOrthos rumbled agreement. \u201cWe have everything we need.\u201d\n\u201cNo, we don\u2019t!\u201d Mercy\u2019s distant voice came drifting on the wind. They all turned, but she wasn\u2019t visible yet.\nShe shouted from within the tunnels. \u201cWait! Hold on! Almost there! There\u2019s more of this than I thou\u2014Aha!\u201d Mercy emerged triumphantly from underground, raising Suu to the sky.\nTears had dried on her cheeks, but she seemed like she had pulled herself together.

He had worried that Malice\u2019s treatment might have left wounds that couldn\u2019t be so easily fixed.\nShe probably had, he knew. But Mercy was starting to heal.\n\u201cWe\u2019re missing a name!\u201d Mercy cried.\nLindon winced.\nYerin appeared next to him in a flash of white light. As soon as she did, she wrapped an arm around his waist, but spoke dryly to Mercy. \u201cThought we could skip that part this time.\u201d\n\u201cNo! We can\u2019t live somewhere without a name!\u201d\nOrthos eyed Dross. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to call this Death\u2019s Midnight Cemetery, are you?\u201d\n[I told you to forget that! Forget it! Bring me those memories so that I can eat them!]\nYerin grabbed Dross before he could fly over to Orthos. \u201cYou\u2019re not all death and skulls anymore, true? All right, then, show it to us. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\nDross glowered at Orthos for another second before drawing himself up and clearing his throat. [Ah, yes. As you know, I was born in the mighty world of Ghostwater. We should name this place after that one, right? Right. So, I present to you\u2026]\nHe spread boneless arms wide. [Drosswater.]\nLittle Blue sounded like a strangled whistle.\nOrthos choked.\nYerin openly laughed.\nEven Mercy had been struck speechless.\n\u201cI told you they wouldn\u2019t like it,\u201d Lindon said.\n[No, they just\u2014you all don\u2019t appreciate the subtle touches! \u2018Dross\u2019 is the part you throw away, right? Well, we are the ones who have been cast off, or thrown away, by the Monarchs! Set adrift! And from that dross we will forge our revolution!]\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad name,\u201d Ziel said.\nDross folded his arms.

How about\u2026The Room of Spirit and Time!\u201d\n\u201cEh,\u201d Ziel said.\n[I\u2019m still concerned that we haven\u2019t given Drosswater enough consideration.]\nYerin wiped a tear from her eye. \u201cNo water here, is there?

This pocket world is nowhere near as large or complete as Ghostwater, after all. The smallest of Northstrider\u2019s halls could beat this place to death. If halls could fight.]\nMercy brightened. \u201cGhostwind Hall!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t have a shiny history with places that have Hall in the name,\u201d Yerin muttered. She squeezed Lindon. \u201cYou think it might scrape them the wrong way?\u201d\nLindon considered. \u201cI don\u2019t think Northstrider would care, but the Sage of Red Faith would think we were mocking him.\u201d\n\u201cBright welcome to Ghostwind Hall, then,\u201d Yerin said decisively. \u201cOur home \u2018til we can fight the world.\u201d\nLindon surveyed the buildings. And the people standing next to him.\nOne way or the other, they were all going to leave Cradle together.\nHe tightened his arm around Yerin and repeated her words. \u201cUntil we can fight the world.\u201d", "bf07e05b-8a11-4e96-a38b-1351cf770a95": "2\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next day, when Lindon had put all the finishing touches on Ghostwind Hall, he gathered everyone together.\nOrthos, Little Blue, Ziel, Mercy, and Yerin were all spread out in front of him, standing on the smooth ground with the multi-colored sky behind them. They wore various expressions of expectation, from Yerin\u2019s confident patience to Mercy\u2019s excitement to Ziel\u2019s completely blank face. They were waiting to hear his plans for them.\nStill, he hesitated to speak.\n[What are you doing?] Dross whispered to him. [It\u2019s a good plan! Very theoretically sound. In the worst case, they just develop an instinctive hatred for you that sinks into their very souls. But that would be irrational.]\n\u201cI have left various\u2026methods for each of you,\u201d Lindon began. \u201cFor willpower training. Some of you have started working already, which is admirable. As you know, willpower is fundamental for fighting Heralds and Sages. And the Monarchs. You\u2019ve all faced down a Dreadgod before, so you know that.\u201d\nThe various expressions of expectation had started to crumple. Yerin said what he was sure they were all thinking. \u201cSince when did you ramble on instead of talking straight?\u201d\nLindon couldn\u2019t meet her eyes, so he shifted and coughed. \u201cI think\u2014and Dross thinks too\u2014that the most effective way to start training willpower is, uh, directly. You\u2019ll have to get used to resisting the pressure of a powerful sacred artist, so\u2026Apologies, but you\u2019ll be doing willpower training. Against me.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t like stammering and speaking so hesitantly, but the idea made him profoundly uncomfortable. For one thing, proposing that he could suppress them all suggested that he was the most powerful sacred artist there.\nWhich was true, but it was still awkward to say out loud.\nHe also knew what it took to resist such pressure. You had to draw yourself up to push against your opponent, which meant pitting yourself against them directly. It was a lot like hating them.\nHe felt like he was lining them up so that he could bully them.\nNonetheless, once they\u2019d received the explanation, all their expressions eased. Except for Ziel\u2019s, which didn\u2019t change.\n\u201cBury me, I thought you were going to confess to a crime,\u201d Yerin said. She rubbed her hands together eagerly. \u201cWhat\u2019s the prize if we push you down?\u201d\n[I\u2019ll give you some points!] Dross offered, which Lindon thought was irresponsible. There was no points system in place, so that wasn\u2019t a promise he could honor.\n\u201cWhen you can\u2019t take it anymore, take a knee,\u201d Lindon said. He nodded to Orthos. \u201cOr a shell. I\u2019ll take the pressure off immediately.\u201d\nOrthos returned the nod gravely. \u201cHow long should we endure?\u201d\n\u201cAs long as you can. The ultimate goal is to be able to fight while resisting me, but first we need to determine how far you have to go. Whoever collapses first needs the most help.\u201d\nZiel looked around. \u201cIf it\u2019s about how long we each last, we could just line up by advancement level.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be adjusting my pressure for each of you,\u201d Lindon said. Ziel finally showed a dumbfounded expression. Did he think Lindon was bragging? Or perhaps exaggerating his own control?\nWell, his doubts would be answered soon, because Lindon could do it.\nMercy shifted from foot to foot. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we do this individually? I\u2019m concerned it might be embarrassing if we\u2019re all comparing to one another.\u201d\n\u201cApologies, truly, but I do think this is necessary. If we are to fight as a team, we need an accurate understanding of each other\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. It\u2019s not a point of competition but a way to help one another improve.\u201d\nMercy\u2019s shoulders slumped and she shot Little Blue a glance.\nThe Riverseed saw that and gave an indignant chime.\n\u201cFor what it\u2019s worth,\u201d Lindon said, \u201cI do not believe Little Blue will be the first to collapse.\u201d Merely being connected to him had to be decent willpower training, considering what Lindon had put himself through in the last few years, and he could feel Blue\u2019s heart through their bond. Her will was clear, strong, and well-developed.\nShe looked at him and raised her fists in the air with a ringing cheer.\n\u201cAlso\u2026\u201d This was the hardest for Lindon to say, but it was the main point. \u201cI will need to set aside my personal feelings for each of you.", "50a46dc0-6d6a-45c7-9c84-0b3ba1f943dd": "If we are to fight as a team, we need an accurate understanding of each other\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.

Bring all you\u2019ve got. If you think I want you to hold back, your ears have been shut.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not quite my concern,\u201d Lindon hedged. \u201cAs you know, I\u2019ve gone through some changes recently\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take it,\u201d Yerin said confidently.\n\u201cYou might sense deeply that I\u2019m trying to kill you, so please remember\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Mercy called.\n\u201cEnough hesitation,\u201d Orthos said.\nZiel planted his feet and nodded.\nLittle Blue chimed eagerly.\nLindon let out a heavy breath. \u201cAll right. Brace yourselves.\u201d For a moment, Lindon organized his thoughts. He closed his eyes, focusing his willpower and feeling the power that ran through him. The hunger of his arm that now suffused him. The madra channels that were now melted into his flesh.\nThe fury of Blackflame. The emptiness of pure madra. The appetite of a Dreadgod.\nHe gathered it all together and prepared to remove his veil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nWhile Lindon stood there with eyes closed, Orthos tried not to let his amusement show through their contracted bond. The boy was so worried about what they would think of him, as though they hadn\u2019t fought side-by-side for years.\nThey were all aware of how strong Lindon was now. None thought they could compare to him, but they were all eager to try.\nHe was either taking them too lightly or overestimating himself. Those would be unusual problems for Lindon, but this should make a good lesson for him.\nThen Lindon\u2019s eyes snapped open and his veil dropped.\nOrthos shouted involuntarily. He would have staggered back several steps if he could have moved at all.\nA mountain had collapsed onto his shell, and he was held in place by an invisible fist. That wasn\u2019t Lindon, that couldn\u2019t be Lindon. That was a Dreadgod.\nThe Empty Ghost.\nAnd it was coming for him.\nWhite circles on black orbs stared into Orthos, and Orthos knew his death had arrived. He felt the hunger of a predator trying to devour him, and it was all he could do to remain standing. Even his madra was frozen in his spirit, locked in place by sheer terror.\nThe pressure increased by the second, but all Orthos could see were those eyes. They were going to devour him, and the pressure was squeezing him from every angle. His death was everywhere.\nHe had felt nothing like this since the sky had turned black, and even then, at least the disaster hadn\u2019t been focused on him. This time, Death was calling his name.\nHelpless, Orthos collapsed.", "bd18cadb-71e6-4ccf-9ec7-e32d1f3eb376": "* * *\n\nMercy had trained for months in the fifth page of the Book of Eternal Night, among the Dream of Darkness technique. She had practiced resistance against nightmares, and of course she had her experiences facing down the weakened Wandering Titan. Her own mother\u2019s displeasure was significant willpower training.\nShe would be confident pitting herself against most anyone her age in a straight-up contest of will. Lindon would win, she was sure, but she would give him a good run.\nOr so she thought before it came to this.\nIt was as though he\u2019d punched through her rib cage and seized her core in his Dreadgod hand. She could feel his will gripping her from every angle, crushing her body and her spirit, his ravenous hunger ready to devour her whole.\nThe fear and guilt and anger she\u2019d felt fighting against her mother came flooding back. Mercy had thought she had recovered enough from fighting Malice, but the force of Lindon\u2019s spirit felt too much like her mother\u2019s displeasure.\nMercy\u2019s eyes crossed and she tried to summon her armor, but she couldn\u2019t make it work. Desperate, she thought of the seventh page of her Book of Eternal Night.\nThat had a measure of her mother\u2019s will inside it, so it would surely keep her on her feet. But then, what would be the purpose of this test?\nMercy stood as long as she could under the pressure of those black-and-white eyes. Eventually, she could take it no longer and dropped to her knees.\nShe was the second to drop, she saw, but she wasn\u2019t too disappointed.\nAt least she had lost on her own.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nLittle Blue didn\u2019t have any complex feelings about the test. She just tried her hardest.\nEverything she could feel through their bond indicated that Lindon was really trying to kill her. He intended to crush her and eat her.\nBut he wouldn\u2019t actually do that. She didn\u2019t need to come up with any reasons to justify that, she just knew Lindon. He wouldn\u2019t intentionally hurt her. For her, that was an ironclad fact of the universe.\nNo matter what her spirit was telling her, she only had to resist as long as she could. She screamed into the pressure, and though it came out more like a melodious whistle, it helped her stand up for a second longer.\nWhen she fell, she collapsed onto her back and welcomed the relief from the pressure. When she turned and saw Mercy and Orthos already on the ground, she punched one fist into the air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nZiel\u2019s entire body was covered in sweat.\nPressure gripped his madra channels, threatening to twist his spirit in knots. He couldn\u2019t hold back the memories of the Sage of Calling Storms, a grin on his face as he twisted his tools inside Ziel\u2019s soul, subjecting him to that very fate.\nBut Ziel had lived with spiritual pain as a fact of his life for many years.\nHe shoved back out of sheer stubbornness. His fear, his discomfort, Lindon\u2019s razor-sharp desire to kill him; what did those things matter? He would die on his feet.\nAlthough those black-and-white eyes were relentless. They seemed to swallow the world. An endless void.\nIt had been hard enough to meet a weakened Wandering Titan in combat. This was like facing the Dreadgod down, alone, and engaging in a staring contest.\nNow, he was preparing to fight the Weeping Dragon. To do that, he needed this training.\nZiel\u2019s hands started to shake. The tremors traveled up his arms and all the way to his head, though he couldn\u2019t seem to blink or pull his eyes away even if he wanted to.\nThen the vibrations reached his knees, and he collapsed.\nHe thought he\u2019d feel ashamed, but all he felt was relief. And then a small amount of pride.\nHe\u2019d lasted as long as he realistically could. Besides Lindon, the only one still on their feet was Yerin.\nNot a bad result, if he did say so himself.", "0e2717d5-ec40-4a75-ad69-de4d8faf96a1": "* * *\n\nYerin had known how Lindon\u2019s sacred arts had leaped forward after he\u2019d Consumed the Silent King. He was somewhat outside normal advancement now, with a body and spirit more comparable to Heralds despite being a Sage. And she\u2019d known how he struggled with the wills of those he Consumed.\nEven so, she was no slouch herself. She\u2019d faced down the Monarchs and hardly blinked, not to mention denying the will of the Bleeding Phoenix.\nThe others, she knew, couldn\u2019t match Lindon. But she\u2019d give him a race.\nOr so she\u2019d thought.\nThere was no trace of Lindon left anymore. She was facing down the Void Sage. The Master of the Labyrinth. The Dreadgod.\nAnd he was here to kill her.\nHer powerful body didn\u2019t matter before this pressure. She struggled not to bend like a straw at the bottom of the ocean. Her spirit ached, and she felt like it would twist and devour her from the inside-out.\nHer oldest fear.\nShe remembered this hunger, remembered being a parasite that wanted to hollow her out. Now she faced it again, and she trembled.\nBut still she pushed back. She had her pride, and she\u2019d wrestled with her Blood Shadow years before it had become Ruby. She remembered being the Blood Shadow, grappling with Yerin from the inside, and even that added to the strength of her will. She would never give in.\nShe pushed back hard, gazing into Lindon\u2019s eyes, watching for him to slide back a step.\nThe aura around him rippled, causing a slight breeze to tug at his clothes, but he didn\u2019t move his hands from behind his back. He didn\u2019t even blink. He only gazed back, his will unbending steel.\nShe wouldn\u2019t give in. Not if it killed her. She locked her knees and met him defiantly, even when she felt blood trickling from her nose. All her madra cycled rapidly\u2014at least, as much as she could make it move\u2014and she gripped her fists until her fingernails broke skin.\nOnly when Lindon ratcheted the pressure up again did her body fail her.\nShe was flattened to the ground, though he let up instantly. And while she had prepared herself for the possibility of losing, she was still filled with shame.\nShe had thought she\u2019d stand a chance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nLindon looked over his friends coughing, groaning, and shifting on the ground. \u201cApologies,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you all right?\u201d\nHe could feel that they were unharmed, but a round of groans answered him.\n\u201cI hate you,\u201d Ziel said.\n\u201cHow about a break before we try again?\u201d Lindon suggested.\nMercy threw a pebble at his head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nAfter another round of willpower training and a few hours of rest, Lindon was ready to begin individual training. He started with Orthos.\nOrthos and Little Blue were together, and when Lindon had sensed that, he had at first assumed that Little Blue was supporting Orthos as he pushed himself.\nThe truth was closer to the opposite.\nBlue gritted her teeth and braced herself as her body flickered purple. Beside her, a Blood Shadow sheathing a weapon started to melt away from a mace made of dark metal. The spiritual parasite slid through a scripted hunger spear, its power flowing into Little Blue.\nWhen Lindon had sensed her straining, he had thought she was pushing herself to scrub Orthos\u2019 spirit. Instead, Orthos was standing over her, taking up most of the Blackflame training cave and bellowing encouragement.\n\u201cA dragon does not hesitate!\u201d the turtle roared. \u201cShe decides her goals and she seizes them! A dragon does not surrender!\u201d\nLittle Blue\u2019s scream was a high, piercing whistle, and she briefly swelled to half Lindon\u2019s height. Then she compressed herself back down to about a foot tall, and a cloud of blood essence rushed up and out of her.\nShe fell back onto the rock, breathing heavily. Like Dross, she didn\u2019t need to breathe, but she imitated the habit from the people whose spiritual power made up her body.\nThen again\u2026\nLindon paid more attention to the feel of her spirit through their bond. She had developed significantly over the years, both spiritually and physically. It was hard to tell for sure without a direct scan\u2014which he didn\u2019t want to use, lest he distract her\u2014but she might really need to breathe soon.\nIf that were true, she was almost ready.\n\u201cShe\u2019s feeling strong,\u201d Lindon said aloud. He was speaking to Orthos, but he knew Blue would hear it. Sure enough, he felt a spark of gratification from her.\n\u201cShe may be stronger than I am now,\u201d Orthos responded.", "b786d3a8-738e-49cc-b3f1-fda415c63caa": "Then she compressed herself back down to about a foot tall, and a cloud of blood essence rushed up and out of her.\nShe fell back onto the rock, breathing heavily.

Lindon was surprised to hear him say it, but it could be true.\nSpirits were hard to compare to sacred artists or sacred beasts, and Blackflame was much more obvious than pure madra, but in many ways she gave off the spiritual pressure of an Overlady. In terms of her density and state of existence, she reminded him more of advanced Archlord Remnants.\n[Spirits have similar requirements to advance, but they often don\u2019t go through discrete levels of advancement until after Archlord,] Dross said to them all.\n\u201cI\u2019m fully aware of that,\u201d Lindon said.\n[I know, but I like to look knowledgeable. It\u2019s my one role. Do you have to take that from me?]\nLindon moved closer to Little Blue and scanned her. Sure enough, she had developed lungs and a heart, though she probably didn\u2019t strictly need them yet. More importantly, she could handle another dose of his soulfire.\nHe sat down next to her. \u201cI think you\u2019ll be the easiest one to advance.\u201d\nShe gave him a smug cheep.\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re recovered, I\u2019ll give you some soulfire.\u201d After she stabilized, her advancement would be down to absorbing Lindon\u2019s madra. In a few weeks or a handful of months, she would have adapted to the full power of his pure core.\nThen it would come down to her to advance to Herald.\nHe looked over her again. She had been with him longer than anyone but Yerin, and now that he thought of it, she had pushed herself harder than he realized. Even processing his scales would have been a trial for her at first.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard,\u201d Lindon said. He dipped his head to her. \u201cGratitude.\u201d\nWithout sitting up, Little Blue opened her mouth.\n\u201cOh, of course.\u201d With a moment of concentration, Lindon Forged a scale. It wasn\u2019t the full power he was capable of, but it was balanced and stable. He matched it to Little Blue\u2019s current level, as he estimated it.\nHer head deformed to swallow the coin, though the scale dissolved into energy as it went down her throat. She patted her stomach with a satisfied sigh.\nLindon looked to Orthos.\n\u201cI have eaten what you left for me,\u201d the turtle rumbled, \u201cbut I have a long road to travel. I don\u2019t see how I can make it in time.\u201d\nLindon had left Orthos elixirs and scales meant to prepare him to receive greater powers. In Lindon\u2019s opinion, that didn\u2019t even count as the first step.\n\u201cAre you willing to do what it takes to join me?\u201d Lindon asked.\nHe half-expected a jibe in response, but Orthos\u2019 red-and-black eyes met him seriously. \u201cI am.\u201d\n\u201cThen listen, both of you.\u201d Lindon drew himself up and radiated a grave air through his bond with the two of them. \u201cYou won\u2019t make it to Monarch. Not in the time we have left.\u201d\nThey exchanged glances, and he felt their mild confusion.\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Orthos said.\n[Orthos, your body and spirit are too\u2026well-established.

But you gathering the required wisdom and insight to touch an Icon would be\u2026ah\u2026hmmm\u2026]\nWhile Little Blue sat and innocently waited for the end of that sentence, Lindon cut in. \u201cYou won\u2019t be Monarchs in your own right, but you\u2019ll be able to borrow my power. You will be ready to fight the Dreadgods, the same as any of us.\u201d\nOf course, all those problems had solutions. If Lindon was willing to stretch the Monarch artifacts further, he could bend the rules for Little Blue and Orthos. But preparing them to reach Monarch would cost more effort and borrowed authority than everyone else combined.\nEven with fortunes stolen from all over the world, Lindon didn\u2019t have the resources for that. Not to mention the time.\nBoth Orthos and Little Blue trembled inwardly when he mentioned fighting Dreadgods, but they remained resolved.\nLindon rolled his right shoulder and his Dreadgod arm quivered eagerly. \u201cThen let\u2019s get started. Orthos, release one of the black dragon Remnants, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\nHe\u2019d left most of the Remnants for Orthos\u2019 use, and at the request, Orthos released one of the Underlord Remnants from his void key.\nThere were Gold spirits in there too, but clearly Orthos did not mean to have an easy start. That wasn\u2019t bad thinking. He could Consume the easiest Remnants when Lindon and Dross weren\u2019t around to help.\nClose to mindless, the serpentine spirit of red-and-black flame dove at Lindon. Lindon caught it effortlessly in his right hand, ignoring its snarls and snapping jaws. He spoke loudly to be heard over the thrashing Remnant.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to transfer everything I can to you, but it\u2019s not just madra. There\u2019s still willpower and memories left in the spirit, and traces of blood and life essence. I\u2019m going to send it to you and help you separate it all, but you\u2019ll have to endure and control it on your own.\u201d\n[Not everything, of course,] Dross pointed out. [We\u2019ll start with about forty percent of the mental power, because you don\u2019t have me. Your brain is like\u2026have you ever filled an eggshell with so much egg that it cracks from the inside?]\n\u201cNo,\u201d Orthos said. \u201cNo one ever has.\u201d\n[I find that unlikely.]\nLindon tried to keep them both focused. \u201cThis will strain you. You\u2019ll have to wrestle directly with the remaining will of the dragon, and you may experience a moment where you aren\u2019t sure who you are. We\u2019ll help you as much as we can, but ultimately it will be up to you.\u201d\nOrthos braced all four of his feet on the ground, and smoke rose from his shell as he cycled his Blackflame madra. \u201cI will know what you have endured all this time.\u201d\nThat made even Lindon hesitate as he remembered all the discomfort and disorientation he\u2019d endured when Consuming others for the first time. But they wouldn\u2019t advance in record time without breaking some rules.\nAnd Orthos said he was ready.\n[I\u2019ll give you a countdown. One and a half, one, now!]\nLindon Consumed the Underlord Remnant. It dissolved and flowed up his arm in an instant, barely a sip compared to the bites he\u2019d taken from Dreadgods and Monarchs. His arm seethed in dissatisfaction, having received a faint mist when it expected a solid meal.\nHe kept the limb under control, carefully separating the energies from the Remnant while keeping them intact. It was harder than just drinking them himself, but still a trivial task.\nThe memories would have been more difficult to deal with if not for Dross, and a Remnant\u2019s memories were always fractured and faint compared to a living being.\n[This isn\u2019t really forty percent,] Dross whispered to Lindon. [But it\u2019s enough for now.]\nWhile keeping careful control, Lindon poured the power through his contracted bond to Orthos.\nThe turtle shuddered as energy entered him.", "d96a3cfd-91b8-43dc-bb92-d8f9b9596056": "One and a half, one, now!]\nLindon Consumed the Underlord Remnant.

[But it\u2019s enough for now.]\nWhile keeping careful control, Lindon poured the power through his contracted bond to Orthos.\nThe turtle shuddered as energy entered him. He took the Blackflame madra easily, of course, cycling it to his spirit and using it to condense his core. The few remaining wisps of gray soulfire settled peacefully as well.\nWrestling against the Remnant\u2019s willpower was harder. When the madra left Lindon\u2019s control, it still had some of the spirit\u2019s original will left animating it, and that power tried to take control of Orthos\u2019 spirit.\nThe temperature in the cave rose several degrees, and Little Blue whistled in concern. Black-and-red sparks flickered into being here and there, and Orthos\u2019 body shuddered.\nGreen life essence and crimson blood essence settled in next, carrying yet more of the dragon\u2019s will. Then the memories rushed through.\nWeaker these thoughts might have been, but Lindon still felt spikes of emotion associated with fractured images. Rage and terror against a distant human figure with silver runes spinning around her. Protective love for a clutch of eggs. Confusion and awe at the sight of a mysterious aura phenomenon that lit the horizon with a rainbow.\nThese were some of the few broken memories that had survived this dragon\u2019s death, and Orthos tossed his head as he received them, his eyes rolling wildly in his skull. He struggled as though against an invisible leash, but he couldn\u2019t escape.\nLindon\u2019s heart tensed. Neither he nor Dross could fight through this process on his behalf. They had made it as easy as they could, but Orthos would have to do this himself.\n\u201cWhere\u2026\u201d Orthos muttered. \u201cWho\u2026\u201d He looked at Lindon in panic, and dragon\u2019s breath kindled between his jaws.\nLindon stood calmly before Orthos, hands clasped behind his back. He radiated complete faith and confidence through their bond.\nAnd so, he noted, did Little Blue. She sent Orthos cheers both audible and otherwise, running around him in circles as though to inspire him with her energy.\nA moment later, the cloud passed from behind Orthos\u2019 eyes. The dragon\u2019s breath died inside his mouth, and he settled heavily onto the ground.\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what it\u2019s like,\u201d he rumbled. \u201cI hate it.\u201d\nLindon scratched the side of his head instead of responding. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant process, but Lindon still found it satisfying. It was the most direct way to improve.\n[Think of it this way: only three more of those, and then you\u2019ll be ready to advance to Overlord!]\nOrthos coughed out ash.\n[\u2026maybe four,] Dross corrected.\nLindon rested a hand on Orthos\u2019 head. \u201cIt\u2019s a big step. Rest and cycle. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll give you the hunger weapon I made for you, and you can try Consuming one of the Golds on your own.\u201d\nEven from that one Remnant, the turtle was noticeably stronger. This was the fastest way to strengthen him, but Lindon was still worried.\nFor one thing, this method would only work for Orthos and Little Blue, and Blue would only need a few more treatments. For Orthos\u2026\n[Fourteen,] Dross said cheerily. [Four Golds, to get him used to the memories. Then five more Underlords, three Overlords, and two Archlords. I won\u2019t tell him yet, though. Keep it a surprise!]\nLindon pictured fourteen more treatments. They wouldn\u2019t get easier to endure, either. Lindon would have to ramp up the portions of willpower and memory that he transferred, and Orthos would need longer to rest between each one.\nThey also didn\u2019t have enough Remnants. They only had two Overlords and one Archlord.\n[I don\u2019t want you to start thinking I approve of Consuming sentient spirits, because I don\u2019t want you to eat me, but we do have a Herald spirit too.", "c41f5f2b-a27b-410b-a1de-1590453c3638": "For one thing, this method would only work for Orthos and Little Blue, and Blue would only need a few more treatments.

Maybe just a sip\u2026]\nLindon looked to the cave\u2019s ceiling, where a huge black-and-red spirit had quietly curled up and pretended he didn\u2019t exist. Noroloth, the Remnant of an ancient black dragon Herald, hadn\u2019t even cycled the abundant Blackflame aura that suffused the air here. At least, not since Lindon walked in. That was the Remnant equivalent of holding a breath.\nNoroloth shuddered at Lindon\u2019s gaze but gave a shaky smile. \u201cI apologize for not greeting you, Monarch! I was terrified that I might interrupt your time with your students.\u201d\nLindon suspected that was true.\nThe spirit of the black dragon prince looked less like a natural dragon than most of their Remnants. He was red, for one thing, with black only showing in patches here in there and in the black-and-red flames that burned around his back. His head was more than double the width of the rest of his body, his jaw exaggerated into an underbite, and his tail dissolved to smoke.\nThat tail wagged now. His smile looked hideous on his too-large head.\n\u201cI would like you to supervise Orthos\u2019 training,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cI\u2019m sure you have insights into the Path of Black Flame that would serve him well.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Monarch, of course! Whatever you wish!\u201d The Remnant\u2019s smoky tail wagged faster.\nDross materialized in front of Noroloth\u2019s face and glared at him. [I still don\u2019t trust you, new guy.]\nNoroloth\u2019s tail froze.\n\u201cI have no doubt he can handle it.\u201d Lindon patted Little Blue and rested his hand on Orthos\u2019 head. \u201cYou all can.\u201d\nOrthos grunted, still reeling from the impact of the foreign willpower.\nLindon left the cave, trying to prevent Orthos from picking up on his frustration. They had only started, but he still felt every second they lost.\nBy traditional logic, there was no way to force sacred artists through the Lord realm. The gold dragons had pumped Sopharanatoth as full as they dared, and it had led to critical instability in her spirit. All due to a lack of time.\nBut he had resources they didn\u2019t, and he needed to rely on those. Hunger madra. The labyrinth. Treasures stolen from the Monarchs. Dross.\nMore importantly, he had a plan.\n[Caaaaaalllllllmmmmm,] Dross drew the word out in such a strange manner that it didn\u2019t feel very calming. [Settle dooooooowwwwwnnnn. Relaaaaaaaxxxx.]\nPlease stop.\n[We have plans for this already. Rely on the plan. Trust the plan.]\nThey\u2019re just not there yet, Lindon said silently. It wasn\u2019t really the resources he was worried about. Orthos, Little Blue, Mercy, Ziel\u2026he was still afraid they were coming along because he and Yerin wanted them to. None of them had the drive he did.\nIf he had been in Orthos\u2019 position, then after Consuming his first Remnant, he would have begged for another.\n[I feel compelled to mock you for your arrogance, but you\u2019re not wrong. That\u2019s almost exactly what you did when you first started using Consume.]\nLindon pushed down his doubt before it could leak through their connection and affect Orthos. As much as anyone, Lindon knew how advancing through the various stages of the Lord realm and fighting directly against the wills of others could help clarify yourself. Orthos would change and grow through this process. So would the others.\nWalking this path would prepare them for the rest. He had to trust that. Trust them.\nI need to focus, Lindon thought.

He had people for that.\nBut the skills of Ozmanthus Arelius, one of the greatest Soulsmiths of all time, still flowed through his mind and spirit. Instincts honed by years of practice, the insight of a genius, and decades if not centuries of weapons-crafting experience now lurked inside Reigan Shen. Now and then, he even felt a shadow of the human\u2019s arrogance bubbling up.\nIt was the one thing he appreciated about the man.\nThe core binding of Subject One was too valuable a material for Reigan to trust to others, but it was also unique and irreplaceable, and thus unsuitable for amateurs. His teams of expert Soulsmiths had labored ceaselessly for days while he breathed down their necks, giving them direction filtered through the talents of his greatest enemy.\nThey finally turned it into the form he wanted, and they had certainly earned their reputations. If they weren\u2019t fine craftsmen, he wouldn\u2019t have retained their services in the first place. Even his memories of Ozmanthus approved.\nThe Wraith Horn\u2014which was his current working title for the wide-mouthed trumpet made from Subject One\u2019s binding\u2014was carved with delicate swirls until it resembled a seashell. It looked like it had grown into the shape of a horn by natural forces rather than design.\nIt was a pure, smooth gray-white, like most of Subject One\u2019s body, but Reigan could only admire its surface in brief stints. The treasure warped the air around it by the mere weight of its existence, so he usually had to keep it sealed away.\nThe Horn had several applications, as expected from the product of such a fine material. But one was of most interest to him at the moment. He could send a call through it, which would reach the other Dreadgods as though it came from the Slumbering Wraith itself.\nIntelligent as they now were, they might be aware it was a trap, but this spoke to their instincts. They would follow its lure.\nThis was the leash he had placed on the Dreadgods. His current plan.\nHis first plan, to gain the power of a Dreadgod for himself, had been ruined by the very man whose Soulsmithing skill now infused Reigan\u2019s spirit.\nReigan looked over the distant Sacred Valley and reflected on how much time and money he\u2019d wasted.\nIf only he\u2019d known who Eithan was. Reigan Shen would have been Tiberian\u2019s best friend. He might have even followed the man\u2019s plan; there were ways to turn forced ascension to an advantage.\nBut now wasn\u2019t the time for regret. Now was the time for desperate survival.\nHe had no need to call the Dreadgods now. They were headed where he wanted them anyway: for Lindon and Yerin Arelius. No matter what else he did, he needed those two gone. His greatest nightmare was that they could return centuries later as Ozmanthus had, in disguise, but he suspected that had only been allowed because the Arelius Patriarch had disguised himself as one of his own descendants.\nHe needed the rest of them out of Cradle before they left any little humans behind.\nNow the Weeping Dragon was going to do his job for him, but Reigan Shen needed to make sure everything went according to plan. Then again, this plan was already going wrong.\nHe couldn\u2019t sense Lindon anywhere.\nThere was a barrier around Sacred Valley, projected by the great labyrinth, and he had expected Lindon to be waiting behind it. He didn\u2019t sense as much, but that told him little. No matter what detection methods he used, there was always the possibility that Lindon had come up with a way to hide from him.\nHe had requested each Monarch tell him what Lindon had stolen from them, but no one had cooperated. They might even know where Lindon was, but they hadn\u2019t shared that with him either. As far as he knew, Lindon could be almost anywhere and could have access to practically anything.\nAnd from Reigan Shen, he had stolen the core to a pocket world.\nReigan had to assume that Lindon was tucked away somewhere in a space that had been time-warped to the extreme. Days could be passing every second.\nIn the worst-case scenario, half a dozen Monarchs could burst out at any moment. They could swarm the Weeping Dragon and from its corpse fashion a weapon to slay Reigan Shen.\nThat was monumentally unlikely. For one thing, they didn\u2019t have Eithan leading them forward now, so they were far more likely to run into one of the thousand potential roadblocks to advancement.\nIf it was so easy to manufacture Monarchs, someone would have done it already.", "3f8d76ef-50a6-4adc-81ca-a1136c1a8514": "They might even know where Lindon was, but they hadn\u2019t shared that with him either.

He had the unlimited consumption powers of Subject One, an unknown number of resources and hidden projects stolen from Monarchs, and\u2014perhaps worst of all\u2014guidance from Ozmanthus Arelius.\nA feeling of smug arrogance drifted up from the Soulsmith inheritance inside Reigan, and he had to force it down.\nAs much as he tried to convince himself that advancing multiple people to Monarch at once was impossible, Reigan Shen had the uncomfortable premonition that it might really happen.\nHe needed to take action immediately, but first he floated in the sky for a long moment, considering his options.\nLindon would have preparations against attacks, and Reigan was more than familiar with the capabilities of the labyrinth. With that under his control, Lindon could have any number of nasty surprises ready and waiting.\nWhat if Lindon wasn\u2019t in Sacred Valley at all?\nWhat if he was?\nReigan could break down the barrier Lindon had left around the Valley, given enough time, but was that the best way to pressure him?\nHe needed to corner Lindon. To run the young man out of energy, focus, and time. To exhaust him so he couldn\u2019t face the Weeping Dragon.\nPack tactics. Cut off the prey\u2019s escape routes and run it into the ground, until it collapsed from exhaustion and waited to be eaten. A hunt worthy of a lion.\nHe only had to pull Lindon out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nLindon found Ziel seated in a cycling position in front of the Paths of Heaven, which was what Dross called the eight rooms filled with illusions of the ancient Abidan.\nSeven of the Paths were dormant, their constructs inactive. With no illusions, they were nothing but plain three-sided rooms of white stone.\nOnly one of the displays was activated: the second one from the left, with the symbol that reminded Lindon strangely of the Wandering Titan. It displayed a pure, shining blue wall, and it radiated authority that suggested an unbreakable shield.\nDespite the feeling of protection and security it generated, Lindon still couldn\u2019t regard the display directly for long. Even this replica was too far beyond him. Staring at the real thing long enough to make it had almost made him pass out.\n\u201cI\u2019ll reach the peak of Archlord soon,\u201d Ziel said, without turning around. \u201cThought I\u2019d prepare myself early.\u201d\nHis worn gray cloak spread out over his shoulders and onto the ground behind him, displaying the symbol that resembled spread wings. The emblem of the Dawnwing Sect.\n\u201cYou\u2019re close,\u201d Lindon said.\n\u201cI\u2019m on the edge of something, but I still need one last step. Like stepping off a cliff.\u201d\nLindon remembered his own first contact with an Icon and nodded. It had taken him new insight into himself to touch the Void Icon, but from everything he had come to learn, it wasn\u2019t about understanding alone.\n\u201cIt takes action to trigger,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cWhat Icon is it?\u201d\nZiel deactivated the Paths of Heaven display, and both Lindon and Dross let out a relieved breath. He stood, brushing himself off without looking at Lindon directly. \u201cI\u2019d rather not say.\u201d\nDross stared at him with one wide eye. [What?]\n\u201cThat\u2019s his decision,\u201d Lindon said to Dross, but he was disappointed too. Did Ziel still not trust them?\nZiel shifted uncomfortably. He glanced to Dross and then back up at the sky. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026embarrassing,\u201d he muttered at last.\n[Oh, then you can tell us quietly.]\nThere was a collection of memories embedded into the labyrinth, and many of them were from Sages.

He had even mentioned a Joy Icon, which Lindon had never heard from anyone else.\n[If Ziel taps into the Joy Icon, I will give up forever, because the world no longer makes sense.]\nDross didn\u2019t send that message to Ziel, but Lindon still considered what he knew of the other man.\nThe Hammer Icon was manifested by Soulsmiths as often as people who used hammers in combat, but it tended to have different powers depending on whether it represented creation or battle. That led to great debate over whether there were two different Hammer Icons or whether hammers had greater depth of meaning.\nThere was no such thing as a Script Icon; Lindon was fairly certain of that. Scripts themselves were made up of many runes that each represented a fragment of meaning, but now that he thought of it, there had to be some Icon that scriptors could manifest.\nMaybe the Scribe Icon? Scholars had manifested that throughout history, in the form of a quill or brush or pen over a page.\nZiel could clearly see the thoughts moving behind Lindon\u2019s eyes, because he grumbled under his breath. \u201cIf I can\u2019t reach it on my own, I\u2019ll tell you. But I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll reach it here.\u201d\n\u201cYou probably won\u2019t,\u201d Lindon agreed.\nHis understanding of the exact mechanics of Sage advancement was vague\u2014in fact, as far as he\u2019d learned, no one could predict exactly how Icons behaved\u2014but Ziel had to take action to trigger the advancement, and actions he took while locked away in Ghostwind Hall wouldn\u2019t touch the larger world.\nLindon thought of advancing to Sage here as something like trying to reach the ocean while trapped in a fishbowl.\n\u201cI\u2019ll need a little longer to reach peak Archlord,\u201d Ziel said. \u201cBut since that\u2019s all I can do in here, I\u2019ll figure out\u2014\u201d\nLindon opened his void key and called out three dream tablets.\nThe first one slapped into Ziel\u2019s palm as Lindon explained what it was. \u201cAll the memories about the Rune Queen Emala from the labyrinth, both from her and from her rivals or peers.\u201d A second one flew at Ziel, and he plucked it from the air. \u201cDross\u2019 analysis of her scripting patterns and our suggestions on how to operate the Grand Oath Array with your Path.\u201d\n[We had to speculate wildly,] Dross said. [I\u2019d say probably forty, forty-five percent is us making things up.]\nZiel caught the third tablet.\n\u201cThat one\u2019s from Northstrider,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cDross took it from his oracle codex. It contains research on Emala\u2019s powers and insights into the manipulation of time.\u201d\nZiel looked down to the tablets and back up to Lindon. \u201cIf you\u2019re teaching me how to use it, does that mean...\u201d\nLindon had been waiting for that.\nFrom his soulspace, he released a Divine Treasure. It resembled a silver moon orbited by rings of intricate silver script.\n\u201cI finished it last night. It\u2019s not precisely the same as Emala\u2019s original, but no two Divine Treasures are exactly alike.

The rest came from a handful of Remnants with minor time aspects and the samples of the Rune Queen\u2019s madra you brought back from Shatterspine Castle.\u201d\nReverently, Ziel took the Grand Oath Array. \u201cYou said you could do it, but I still thought\u2026How did you learn to do this?\u201d\n\u201cCompressing the time of this pocket world was good practice,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cAnd, of course, I had Dross\u2019 help. But mostly\u2026\u201d\nLindon extended a pulse of pure madra and activated the fourth Path of Heaven. The illusory cave flickered into visibility, blue-black stone surrounding abstract images that were strange even by the standards of the other ancient Paths. Dull colors swirled and mixed in intricate configurations, forming shapes that reminded Lindon of cycling patterns.\nOr scripts.\nThe symbol over the cavern was a fuzzy humanoid figure, and the whole illusion radiated an authority that was hard for him to identify. Something about it resonated with his Void Icon, like a complementary half, or perhaps an opposite.\nFor Ziel\u2019s sake, he tried to explain. \u201cThese are the principles Northstrider and Emala studied. If I had to name this authority, I would call it \u2018existence.\u2019\u201d\nZiel hefted the silver Divine Treasure in his hand, then absorbed it into his soulspace. \u201cI hate how casually you\u2019ve handed me the keys to manipulate existence itself.\u201d\n\u201cWe have to go at least this far if we want to kill the Weeping Dragon.\u201d\nZiel\u2019s spirit flickered slightly at the reminder, but it was enough to send a ring of dust blasting away from his feet. \u201cYeah. Right.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t need to tell you,\u201d Lindon said quietly, \u201cbut we have to assume the Stormcallers will be with it.\u201d\nZiel trembled. His grip tightened on the dream tablets that remained in his left hand until Lindon was afraid he would break them.\n\u201cI\u2019m not a match for Calling Storms,\u201d Ziel said at last. \u201cEven if I touch an Icon, that won\u2019t change. He\u2019s a monster.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not the only one.\u201d Lindon reached out with force aura and pushed Ziel\u2019s fingers apart so the tablets didn\u2019t shatter in his grip. \u201cYou won\u2019t fight alone.\u201d\n\u201cNeither will he. He has a Dreadgod.\u201d\nLindon flexed his right hand. \u201cSo he does.\u201d His white arm bubbled with hunger. It was practically drooling at the thought of devouring the Weeping Dragon.\nSomething Lindon couldn\u2019t read passed through Ziel\u2019s expression before he tilted his horns up to look at the sky of rainbow clouds. \u201cHow did I get here?\u201d Ziel wondered aloud. \u201cPreparing to fight a Dreadgod with someone who might really win.\u201d\nDross piped up helpfully, [Lindon dragged you here.]\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put it like that,\u201d Lindon said.\nZiel snapped his fingers. \u201cOh yeah, that was it. Guess I have some work to do.\u201d Ziel turned back around to face the Paths of Heaven, the lazy wind tugging at the ragged edges of his cloak, then stopped and glanced over his shoulder. \u201cThanks, by the way. For dragging me.\u201d\nLindon dipped his head wordlessly.\nDross crossed his tendrils. [Don\u2019t encourage him. He drags people too much as it is.]\nZiel sat down instead of responding, returning to his meditation, but Lindon grabbed Dross by the back of the head.\n\u201cYour turn,\u201d Lindon said.\n[Someone help! I\u2019m being dragged!]\nLindon carried Dross in his hand down through a tunnel into Ghostwind Hall\u2019s marble ground. Most of the facilities that had been included in the original pocket world either weren\u2019t finished or weren\u2019t worth much, but some had proved useful.\nOne in particular he had completed the first day.\nThe central control room of the pocket world wasn\u2019t deep beneath the surface.

Like Sacred Valley.\nLindon shut off the alarm that had alerted Dross hours ago. Hours from his perspective. With the time difference cranked up as high as he could make it, less than a minute had passed on the outside.\nSomeone is testing Sacred Valley\u2019s defenses, Lindon sent to Dross, once he deciphered the impressions coming through. He didn\u2019t speak aloud because he didn\u2019t want to disturb anyone else.\n[That would be Reigan Shen,] Dross responded. [He\u2019s hiding, but I smell cat hair.]\nThen we\u2019re almost out of time. Do you have an answer for me?\n[You\u2019re not going to like it. I want to request first that you not take out your inevitable fury on me.]\nLindon\u2019s heart clenched. If Dross had bad news for him, their entire goal here might be impossible.\n[It should be a bow,] Dross said gravely.\nLindon spent a moment thinking how that could be bad news. \u201cI thought you were going to tell me it was impossible.\u201d\n[I wracked my brain for other options, but the tendons will make an acceptable bowstring, and\u2014with a little bit of encouragement from you\u2014we can incorporate the bones. The binding is mind-bending to consider, even for me, but it should work well for Forging convincing illusionary arrows and affecting the dream aura of the targets. Probably more.]\n\u201cI\u2019m still waiting for the bad news.\u201d\n[The bad news is that I can\u2019t use a bow!] Dross floated around the room in agitation, thrashing his flexible arms. [We get the most powerful binding compatible with me in the world, and I can\u2019t even use it.]\n\u201cWe could make it into a launcher.\u201d\n[Not if we want to maximize the binding. Like you asked me to. The shape adds a lot, so it needs to be a material weapon.]\n\u201cHow\u2019s its compatibility with shadow madra?\u201d\n[If Mercy touched this bow, her eyes would melt.]\n\u201cFor now,\u201d Lindon said. Once she mastered the seventh page of her Book and they advanced her past Archlord, she would need a new weapon.\n[Here\u2019s an idea that\u2019s just striking me out of nowhere, feel free to say no, but we could use it.] Dross floated behind Lindon and pointed an arm out as though showing him a glorious future. [Imagine us with four Dreadgod weapons\u2014five, if you count your arm\u2014traveling around and devouring people\u2019s minds. Feeding them straight to me. All to Dross.]\nDross projected the image of himself growing larger and larger until he dwarfed mountains, then popping Northstrider into his open mouth.\n\u201cThat would be too much to handle.\u201d Not only would the compatibility issues of balancing four Dreadgod weapons at once be a monumental task, but it was enough of a strain on Lindon\u2019s willpower wrestling with his arm.\nDross gave Lindon a skeptical look.\n\u201c\u2026but of course there\u2019s plenty of Dreadgod material besides their core bindings,\u201d Lindon continued. \u201cWe\u2019ll find something for us. And we will borrow the bow until Mercy can handle it.\u201d\nThat was just good sense. The weapon would be ready before its wielder, but they couldn\u2019t leave it sitting around. Not when they could use it against Reigan Shen.\nSatisfied, Dross nodded and opened Lindon\u2019s second void key.\nThis key, stolen from Sophara, had almost collapsed under the spiritual weight of a Dreadgod\u2019s corpse. He had been forced to move everything else out so the space didn\u2019t dissolve, and even then, he had to wrap the Dreadgod\u2019s corpse in scripted bandages to ensure stable long-term storage.\nLindon dragged the elephant-sized body of the Silent King out of the void key with one hand.

The scripts all over the wrappings had begun to deform their cloth, so he burned them off in an instant with one brief flex of fire aura.\nAs soon as the restrictions were gone, all of Ghostwind Hall trembled.\nThe dead Dreadgod filled the cave with the stench of blood, sweaty fur, and a sickly-sweet smell that Lindon associated with dreadbeasts. The scorched cloth added smoke to the mix, so Lindon had Dross seal off his sense of smell.\n\u201cWhat will happen to the bow if the Silent King comes back to life?\u201d Lindon asked. He had considered the question before; if the Dreadgods kept resurrecting, then they could potentially be an endless farm for Monarch-level materials.\nNot that cultivating Dreadgods seemed like a good idea, but Lindon couldn\u2019t help considering.\n[The madra loses consistency and begins to degrade as the world breaks it down,] Dross said with a heavy sigh. [Obviously, the first thing I tried to design was a network of fourteen Silent King bindings under my control, but the exclusionary nature of Dreadgod materials is relatively well-documented. Has to do with the mechanism of their resurrection.]\nLindon had expected that, and he didn\u2019t intend to allow the Dreadgod\u2019s rebirth anyway, but he was still disappointed.\nUsing force and wind aura, he levitated the great tiger\u2019s body into the center of the room. It would be better for Yerin to help with this next part, which required both precise incisions and controlling blood, but she was in the middle of her own training. Instead, Lindon set up a basic red construct to collect spilled blood then pulled out a goldsteel knife.\nDross highlighted the correct place for the first incision: a line down from the center of the neck. Standing in front of the corpse, Lindon was acutely aware of its size. The Dreadgod could have swallowed him in two bites.\nNot long ago, Lindon had stood before it in battle. The memory of its presence overwhelmed him for a moment. Its spiritual and physical weight. The constant threat of death. Its power.\nHe could Consume this corpse. Drain it dry. There was more power left in the body, and he didn\u2019t need a bow. Mercy couldn\u2019t use it yet, and they needed the Silent King\u2019s power against the Weeping Dragon. Why hadn\u2019t he done this already?\nLindon had almost placed his right hand on the tiger\u2019s skin when Dross materialized in front of him. [No! Bad arm! Down!]\nLindon jerked his hand away.\nThat had been too close. When the arm\u2019s instincts fought him directly, he could win, but this time he hadn\u2019t noticed when the hunger madra\u2019s desires had begun to bleed into his own.\nEmbarrassed, Lindon tucked his right hand behind his back and sliced into the Dreadgod\u2019s skin with the knife in his left.\nEven deprived of the Silent King\u2019s living spirit and will, the hide was tough. He had to gather sword aura around the blade of his knife and push with a significant portion of his strength. After that first incision, though, the process became easier.\nAs Lindon skinned and cleaned the Dreadgod, its blood splattered on the floor and then was drawn up into a ball around the simple construct he\u2019d set up. The blood-aspect construct would certainly be warped by the touch of the Silent King\u2019s blood, but that would be a fascinating experiment in its own right.\nLindon had dissected dozens if not hundreds of dreadbeasts in the past, so he knew something of what to expect. The Dreadgod\u2019s spirit was twisted and merged through its body in the form of shining white threads that wove through its muscles, tendons, and bones until the power made a complex tapestry.\nThat was far more thorough than any other dreadbeast he\u2019d encountered before, as expected.

A hand reached out to grab his wrist, a scream came from behind, and even his spiritual perception picked up a massive presence heading to kill him.\nAll illusions, and all convincing.\nDross shielded him and Lindon focused his own will, but without the cooperation between the two of them, the dissection process would have been impossible.\nThe room warped and shifted as he continued, until Lindon cut deep enough into the Dreadgod\u2019s chest to reveal a white core that shone like a twisted sun. Its light was wrong somehow, greasy and slick, as it tried to warp and corrupt the world around them.\nLike the binding of the Tomb Hydra, this one had a complex, round shape with multiple applications. Unlike that one, which had still resembled a normal binding, this one burned against Lindon\u2019s eyes and spiritual senses. It was like an organic star, squirming in the grip of his goldsteel tongs, and half a dozen apertures opened and closed all over its surface like blinking eyes.\nDross had a catalogue of memories from Soulsmiths ready for Lindon\u2019s consideration.\nAll of them had made bows before, and Lindon let their expertise bubble at the back of his mind as he considered the binding, the bones, the tendons, and the material of the Silent King\u2019s spirit.\nThen he entered the Soulforge and began his work.", "79a6fe42-c999-430a-9801-aad8100bfe09": "4\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo more days had passed in the pocket world before Lindon judged that he should leave to defend Sacred Valley.\n[Longer than we expected,] Dross observed. [Reigan Shen must be afraid if he\u2019s approaching so carefully. That, or he has a perfect, inescapable plan to kill you.]\nYerin froze with one of her sword-arms poised to descend on Lindon. They had been sparring in the sky, testing out some niche uses of their techniques, but she sensed the same thing Lindon had.\n\u201cYou looking for company?\u201d Yerin asked.\nLindon pulled his main void key from around his neck and tossed it and the string from which it hung to Yerin. \u201cBetter if only I go. I\u2019ll adjust the flow of time so it won\u2019t move quite so quickly while I\u2019m gone. I should be back by tomorrow, from your perspective.\u201d\nShe stepped closer and looked up at him, clearly worried. \u201cBleed me if it wouldn\u2019t be smarter to go together.\u201d\nLindon gathered her up in his arms. \u201cThere\u2019s not much he can do to me in Sacred Valley with the protection of the labyrinth. He\u2019s trying to waste our time, and I don\u2019t want him to waste yours too.\u201d\n\u201cYou stone-certain of that, are you?\u201d\n[How certain can we be of anything in this world?] Dross asked philosophically.\nLindon bid Yerin goodbye before heading to the scripted doorway at the edge of their pale stone island. Everyone here would sense him leave, but he should be back soon.\n[I\u2019m getting nervous. You want to wait here a little longer?]\nThrough his observation network, Lindon had felt the nature of Shen\u2019s attack on Sacred Valley. It was a barrage of launcher constructs; strong, but nothing the barrier he\u2019d left around the labyrinth couldn\u2019t handle.\n\u201cBy leaving, we\u2019re playing right into his hands,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t leave, he will eventually get in. There are still people down there.\u201d\nHe had left them other protections, but even so, the people he was sheltering in Sacred Valley couldn\u2019t handle a Monarch.\n[I have wanted a good weapons test,] Dross admitted.\nLindon stepped through the doorway to the outside and found himself drifting over the Trackless Sea. The clouds drawn by the Weeping Dragon had crept slightly closer, and he could see glimpses of the Dreadgod itself as it wove in and out of its bed of clouds.\nThough that wasn\u2019t the enemy that concerned him.\nWith arms crossed, Lindon propelled himself down. Into the depths of the sea.\nAs he\u2019d seen Northstrider do years before, Lindon sank rapidly to the bottom of the ocean. Where a branch of the labyrinth waited.\nMinutes later, he emerged in Sacred Valley to the sound of distant thunder.\nReigan Shen had given up stealth. He lounged openly in midair with his arms folded, staring imperiously over the Valley. From the air behind him, gold-edged portals unleashed a barrage of Striker techniques. Hundreds of them at once, representing every conceivable combination of aspects.\nThey slammed against an invisible wall when they crossed the barrier into Sacred Valley. The suppression field had never been intended as the primary defensive function of the great script; it wasn\u2019t even the default setting. However, the script could be overloaded, and a shield like this one was vulnerable to more subtle attacks.\nLindon felt the panicked spirits of everyone in the Valley as they witnessed the assault. While the original buildings were mostly still rubble scattered for miles between the three remaining sacred peaks, there were more people living in Sacred Valley than ever.\nRefugees from all over the world, who had fled from the Dreadgods, now sheltered here. Members of the three original clans and four schools, certainly, but also people from the Desolate Wilds, the Blackflame Empire, and Dreadnought City in Everwood.\nEven Redmoon Hall\u2019s cloudship sat on the ground, now flying the two-colored star of the Twin Star Sect. In fact, Lindon saw that symbol everywhere he looked.\nWhen had that happened?\nThey were all protected by the great script, and many of them hid in the outer layers of the labyrinth itself. Lindon had left several entrances open; all the ones where ordinary Golds could enter without getting themselves killed.\nMany people down there were calling his name. Including some voices he knew.\nHe could feel their intentions in his spiritual sense, like a distant whisper or a tapping on his shoulder. That ability was a relatively new development, but Lindon had no time to reassure anyone.

Lindon reached the edge of the shield in seconds and passed through it without hesitation.\nThe enemy Monarch\u2019s launcher constructs went silent and retreated, their portals closing. He didn\u2019t want to lose his treasures.\nBesides, Reigan Shen had achieved his objective the moment Lindon revealed himself. A smile curled up one corner of his lips, and he raised a goblet that Lindon was certain from experience contained wine.\n\u201cThe Void Sage himself! We keep running into each other, it seems. How would you like to talk?\u201d\nLindon reached into his soulspace. It took a moment to manifest the weapon he held there, due to its sheer spiritual power.\n\u201cRude of you to keep silent, don\u2019t you think? What about your mind-spirit? He\u2019s worth talking to in his own right, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\nDross spun out to hover over Lindon\u2019s head. He squinted at Reigan Shen. [How durable would you say you are? Compared to other Monarchs, I mean. There\u2019s not a good standardized metric, and I\u2019m curious about where you rank. I\u2019m sure Malice is on the high end, thanks to the armor and all.]\nShen arched an eyebrow and sipped from his goblet. \u201cIf that\u2019s a threat, it\u2019s a poor\u2014\u201d\nThe Bow of the Silent King appeared in Lindon\u2019s left hand.\nA grand halo appeared over him, far too large for his body. The clouds danced, or at least seemed to, and the world warped around the weapon. Half-formed sounds and images flickered in and out of existence for miles around.\nThe grip and limbs of the bow were covered by the smooth white hide of the Silent King, drawn tight over its bones. Black stripes remained every few inches, shifting and morphing as though to almost form a picture. The string was invisible until Lindon\u2019s fingers plucked it experimentally, and then it shivered into existence. It trembled strangely, like half a dozen strings of light trying to occupy the same space.\nThrough his connection to the Void Icon, Lindon could feel the weapon\u2019s authority warping perception, dreams, thoughts. Even the Way, the deeper set of rules beneath reality, was touched by this weapon.\nThere was no way he could have tested the Bow inside the pocket world. Even with the separation of the Soulforge, constructing this had almost torn the place apart.\nHe felt its hunger for knowledge, its desire to consume minds and thoughts.\nLindon joined his madra to the bow, and it was almost too overwhelming for him. Fighting his arm and the weapon at the same time was a daunting task; they both whispered at him to give in, to devour everything. It was his right.\nHe tapped into the binding at the heart of the bow and Forged an arrow.\nLindon had expected it to be pure white, like so much of the Silent King\u2019s madra, but it was more than that. The flawless ivory arrow had a gleaming steel head and black-tipped fletching.\nIt was detailed and beautiful, a work of art, so that Lindon almost wondered if it had really been Forged from simple madra. His eyes alone couldn\u2019t tell the difference between this and a physical construction.\nFour shields of wildly different descriptions had already appeared around Reigan Shen, orbiting him lazily. \u201cSo you went with a bow,\u201d Shen called. \u201cNot bad. I thought the stripes might be too much, but they\u2019re tasteful.\u201d\nThe Monarch kept his tone clean, but Lindon could sense his envy. It tasted of hunger.\nLindon responded by drawing the string back to his cheek. He hadn\u2019t trained as an archer the way Mercy had, but he had used much simpler hunting bows here and there as a child. This would be his first time using a bow in years.", "838efe48-eb3e-4205-9283-ce9b7baddf54": "The flawless ivory arrow had a gleaming steel head and black-tipped fletching.\nIt was detailed and beautiful, a work of art, so that Lindon almost wondered if it had really been Forged from simple madra.

This would be his first time using a bow in years.\nThe air trembled under the combination of his own spirit and the power of the Silent King, so Reigan Shen called more and more defenses out of his King\u2019s Key.\nLindon let him.\nHe wanted a good test.\nWhen Shen paused to evaluate whether his defenses were good enough, Lindon released the Forged arrow.\nTen thousand identical arrows released along with it, Forging out of thin air. Even Lindon would have been hard-pressed to find the real one, especially as each arrow was blurred somehow, difficult to catch with the eye or the spiritual sense, as though the original slid in and out of reality.\nThey did not arc and fall, like regular arrows, but instead tore through the air like a flock of bats seeking prey. The volley bent and swarmed toward Reigan Shen, hungry for him.\nA crystalline wall of Forged madra appeared in front of the arrows, generated by one of Shen\u2019s constructs, but they punched through without losing much momentum. A shield floating in midair was torn to pieces after intercepting a handful, while the rest broke through layer after layer of the Monarch\u2019s protections.\nScripts were overloaded and barriers broke as the furious barrage of arrows slowly dwindled.\n[Not too bad,] Dross mused. [In line with my projections. I mean, of course.]\nLindon was relieved. For one Forger technique to push a Monarch this far was impressive, certainly, but he was counting on the Dreadgod weapons to perform at least this well. Otherwise, he had virtually no chance of forcing the Monarchs to ascend.\nAnd, of course, this Monarch had stood there and taken the attack. Reigan Shen dismissed his broken defenses and summoned more, but he wasn\u2019t lounging anymore. His arms were uncrossed and his goblet gone.\nHis goal was to keep Lindon out of the pocket world for as long as possible, no doubt, but he wouldn\u2019t want to take a beating lying down.\n[He\u2019s the perfect target for round two!] Dross declared.\nLindon pulled out a real arrow.\nHe only had twelve of these, made from the material of the Silent King\u2019s body just as the bow itself was. The arrowhead was the tiger\u2019s gleaming fang, the shaft made from one of its bones.\nWhen he put the arrow to the string, the spiritual force emanating from the weapon redoubled. If Lindon had been inside the protection script, the pressure alone would have killed some of the Golds waiting in the Valley.\nReigan Shen wasn\u2019t blind. A larger portal opened behind him, and he shouted to Lindon. \u201cYou won\u2019t find me such an easy target this\u2014\u201d\nLindon released the arrow.\nAnother illusory volley blackened the sky, though this time, the copies resembled this new arrow instead. Each Forged illusion tore the world as it passed, leaving hairline fractures in space that quickly healed.\nThe barrage struck almost instantly, like a flash of ten thousand lights.\nThis time, Reigan Shen didn\u2019t stand still to meet it. While his construct defenses were overwhelmed in a split second, he stepped through a portal into a pocket world. Another portal swallowed most of the arrows.\nExcept, instead of catching the volley, the portal shattered like glass.\nThe weight of authority and significance on these arrows was nothing the portal could handle. They attacked the gateway itself, breaking it and continuing uninterrupted.\nWhen they reached the pocket space in which Shen hid, they swarmed in after him like a hive of bees moving faster than mortal sight could track. They could easily burst such a space, but Lindon was sure Shen wouldn\u2019t let that happen.\nSure enough, Lindon heard a lion\u2019s roar and felt a surge of power. When the Monarch emerged, he was red-faced and furious.\nHe held up the bone arrow. \u201cThank you for your contribution to my collection!", "3f083ed4-fb01-4eab-8dcf-75811ed306e6": "This time, Reigan Shen didn\u2019t stand still to meet it.

In return, I\u2019ll show you what I have to offer!\u201d\nA dozen gold portals opened, and Lindon grew serious. Reigan Shen wasn\u2019t just stalling anymore. There were weapons that could slip past the defensive field of the labyrinth to destroy the people hiding below, and Shen would surely have some.\nLindon called the arrow back.\nIt vanished from Shen\u2019s hand and reappeared in his own, which caused Shen to react as though struck. He would have expected Lindon to summon the arrow back under his own authority, but Lindon had cheated and used the labyrinth.\nHe was stretching it to reach all the way out here, but only a little.\nBefore Shen released his arsenal, Lindon pulled a new type of arrow from his backup void key. Of this type, he only had three. He didn\u2019t yet have the materials to make more.\nThis time, the wave of pressure the arrow radiated was more like silence than a scream. The sounds and waves of power from Shen\u2019s weapons were instantly suppressed.\nWhen Lindon placed this arrow to the string, the weight on his own spirit doubled yet again. He gritted his teeth and fought with all his willpower, trying to keep his focus.\nTo the eye, this arrow resembled the last. Its shaft was made of the Silent King\u2019s bone, as before.\nWhat really differed was the arrowhead.\nThe arrow was tipped with a curved black triangle that had a sharp steel edge. It emanated a wisp of death madra and an overwhelming will to destroy. Its silence reminded him of the shroud that had passed over the world when Eithan had broken his black marble and revealed himself as Ozriel.\nAnd for good reason.\nPenance may have been a one-of-a-kind, single-use weapon, but Ozmanthus Arelius had left many prototypes scattered throughout the world. Lindon had been disappointed to find them missing from the labyrinth, but it turned out they weren\u2019t all gone.\nThree had been hidden.\nLindon controlled the bow, took aim, and focused on Reigan Shen.\n\u201cKill him,\u201d he commanded.\nThen he released the arrow.\nReigan Shen was already gone. The second he\u2019d sensed the power of Penance, he had fled through space. Some of his portals started to close without him there to sustain them, though many of his defensive measures remained in place. No doubt he intended them to slow Lindon down.\nThe arrow still flew, joined by a flock of copies. Where the illusions met defenses, the defenses were erased. They vanished like popped bubbles.\nUntil the true arrow reached the place where Reigan Shen had disappeared.\nIt vanished too.", "f0981ee0-6994-453c-af84-96df5b3c2b94": "Lindon had been disappointed to find them missing from the labyrinth, but it turned out they weren\u2019t all gone.\nThree had been hidden.\nLindon controlled the bow, took aim, and focused on Reigan Shen.\n\u201cKill him,\u201d he commanded.\nThen he released the arrow.\nReigan Shen was already gone.

Of course he had left behind something to kill Monarchs. Something to kill Reigan himself. Ozmanthus would never have left an enemy alive.\nAt least Shen had been wise enough to make preparations of his own.\nWhen he arrived at the first anchor after Sacred Valley, he left behind a script trap and a construct designed to kill Heralds, created a false portal to leave a fake trail, then quietly opened another gateway to his next anchor.\nNo amateur Sage could follow him through that, regardless of his weaponry. Even if he could, Shen had equipment that could handle the combined attack of a Dreadgod and one of Ozmanthus\u2019 prototypes.\nThis escape was one to be proud of. If Lindon did chase him, Reigan could drag out the time the human spent outside of the pocket world. If Lindon didn\u2019t chase, returning to his time-warped hideout, Shen could launch another attack.\nNo matter how much time Lindon had bought himself, Shen could waste it. The existence of these Penance arrows only meant he had to be\u2026careful.\nShen was about to step through the Way again, letting its currents take him anywhere else, when his spirit whispered danger.\nA silver plate, embedded in an intricate platinum bracelet around one wrist, activated. It wasn\u2019t a sacred instrument, but an artifact from the order of Abidan calling themselves the Titans.\nA blue shield of absolute defense formed behind him, and Shen felt a chill as he spun to face it.\nThe shield had stopped a single, black-tipped arrow.\nThough the arrow fell immediately afterward, its attempt foiled, there were reasons Shen didn\u2019t rely on the Abidan shield for everything. For one thing, he didn\u2019t want others to know he had it. It was his vital life-saving measure.\nFor another, it wasn\u2019t meant to be used so frequently. He couldn\u2019t restore its power on his own, so it wouldn\u2019t last forever. Also, its use might attract attention from the heavens, which was the last thing he wanted. Especially now. What if Eithan Arelius could feel this?\nBut he was glad he\u2019d brought it out now. There was no use to emergency life-saving measures if you died while they stayed in storage.\nHe straightened himself and took a deep breath, soothing his fear. The arrow had been the only thing to follow him. Even its Dreadgod-generated illusions couldn\u2019t track him through space, and Lindon wouldn\u2019t be able to do it either.\nAt that very thought, Shen felt the Way shift around him. Only then did he recognize how significant it was that the arrow hadn\u2019t vanished.\nLindon didn\u2019t call it back. He moved himself to its location.\nThe Sage stepped through the Way, his pale right hand pulling back the string and his left hand bracing another arrow. The halo over his head covered the sky like an Icon, and his eyes were circles of white on pools of blackness. He was a monochrome specter, even the badge on his chest white against black robes.\nThose black-and-white eyes sighted down another Penance arrow, and Shen felt fear shiver through his bones.\nA fresh volley of copied arrows thundered against the blue Titan barrier. The protection was absolute, but Shen still stepped into the Way and ran from the location.\nLike a canny tactician luring his enemy into a disadvantageous position.\nNot like prey running from a hunter. Not at all.", "ba087634-8924-46a0-b8fd-47bf17806051": "5\n\n\n\n\n\nLindon called the two Penance arrows back to himself and tossed them into his void key. He was breathing heavily, his head pounding from controlling such power.\n[I have a projection,] Dross offered. [We could chase him.]\nAnd what are my odds of killing him if I chase him? Lindon asked.\n[Not as bad as you might think! But not\u2026stellar, I\u2019ll grant you. Not as long as he has that barrier from the Abidan. Yeah, the odds aren\u2019t too great.]\nHow long will the shield last? Lindon drew the bow into his soulspace, which was also a more painful process than usual. The bow didn\u2019t want to be stored, it wanted to be used, and it wrestled his spirit at every step.\n[Could be exhausted in two or three more shots!] Dross said optimistically. [Or, you know, it could last ten million more years. We have no way to tell. But we can reasonably assume that there\u2019s a way to break it or wear it down, since he\u2019s not an Abidan himself.]\nLindon nodded and reached out to the thin gap in the world where he\u2019d arrived. He pulled it open and stepped through, returning to Sacred Valley. He hovered over the former site of the Wei clan, where most of the wreckage was in shades of white and purple.\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be back to harass us if we don\u2019t follow him,\u201d Lindon said aloud to Dross. There were tactics they could use, knowing that; they had reduced Shen\u2019s options enough that he had become more predictable, which was an advantage.\n[The safest thing would be to stand guard out here. But, of course, that would be doing exactly what he wants.]\nLindon stretched his perception to the northern horizon. The Weeping Dragon\u2019s storm-clouds had come closer. How long had passed inside Windfall? Had it been a whole day yet?\nWithout him and Dross, the others\u2019 attempts to advance would be much less likely to succeed. They needed him.\nHe had turned down the time dilation as far as possible so he would miss as little as possible, but Yerin and the others were still experiencing probably ten minutes for every one of his.\nThat meant he had to hurry and get back, but now that he had driven off Reigan Shen, the number of people speaking his name in the Valley redoubled. Some were only whispering about him, but others were trying to get his attention, and he found it easy to determine which was which.\nEach passing second weighed on him, but he would feel guilty if he left with no further explanation.\n\u201cDross,\u201d Lindon said, \u201cI need you to send six messages. Tell them I\u2019m about to summon them.\u201d\n[Already done. Should I tell them when?]\n\u201cRight now.\u201d\nWithout any more time to waste, Lindon reached out to the labyrinth and summoned everyone he wanted to talk to.\nIn flashes of white light, six people materialized next to him.\nIn midair.\nLindon held them securely with aura, but on reflection, he supposed he should have given them longer to prepare.\nCassias Arelius appeared next to Lindon, and he lost a breath when he noticed that he was suddenly hovering hundreds of feet in the air. He gripped the saber at his belt, and his blue eyes went wide, but he grasped the picture quickly. As expected of an Arelius.\nHe drew himself up and bowed to Lindon, even while floating. His golden hair shone in the sun.\nFisher Gesha did not react so well.\n\u201cAAAAHHHH NO!\u201d She shot a web of purple Fisher madra into the sky, trying to catch herself on something, but of course there was nothing to hold onto and no need. The old woman was curled up, even smaller than usual, breathing heavily and clutching her chest as though afraid her heart would burst.\nHer gray hair, usually neatly tied up, had come loose from its bun. The spider-construct she used as her drudge flailed helplessly, purple legs clawing at empty air, and then it scrambled up to hold onto her back.\n\u201cWha\u2014Did you do this, boy?\u201d She flailed at Lindon, trying to hit him. \u201cWhat were you thinking, hm? Send a message into my thoughts, and before I can turn around, you\u2019re trying to drop me from the top of a mountain! You weren\u2019t thinking at all!\u201d\nLindon\u2019s cheeks burned. \u201cMy humble apologies, Fisher, I was in a\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSome kind of Monarch now, and he thinks he can frighten old women to death! Don\u2019t have wings, do I, hm?\u201d\nAt least the others had adapted more quickly.", "23259a48-81f1-4685-95da-8034ba5664af": "Her gray hair, usually neatly tied up, had come loose from its bun.

Don\u2019t have wings, do I, hm?\u201d\nAt least the others had adapted more quickly.\nKahn Mala of Redmoon Hall looked scornfully on the complaining Truegold. She had reacted more calmly than anyone, as expected of an Archlady. A fall from this height wouldn\u2019t kill her, and she had experienced spatial transport before.\nShe calmly tied back her hair to stop it from flapping in the wind, giving Lindon a respectful nod as she did so. Her Blood Shadow, in the shape of a cobra, nodded to Lindon as well.\nThe other three hadn\u2019t panicked either, which was to their credit, as they were the least advanced of anyone.\nJai Chen wore an outer robe of pale blue and burnt orange with the Twin Star logo on the breast, and she gasped when she appeared but adjusted quickly. Fingerling, her pink dragon spirit, swam merrily through the air.\nHer Path, strange as it was, had wind aspects. She would have cycled at high altitudes before, and Lindon had helped her design some of her techniques himself. If she fell, she could catch herself.\nHis sister Kelsa couldn\u2019t, but she reacted to sudden events well. She would have been ready the moment Dross\u2019 message ended. Her White Fox madra had frozen when she found herself floating in midair, and her purple-and-white tail of foxfire stiffened for a moment. Then she mastered herself, exerting control over her Goldsign.\nLindon\u2019s father, the last of those he\u2019d summoned, had merely closed his eyes and taken a deep, shuddering breath. He carried the cane he no longer needed, and even the scar that had pulled his mouth up into a permanent sneer had been healed somewhat by his advancement to Jade.\nLindon saved him for last. He had been surprised enough to hear Wei Shi Jaran call his son\u2019s name at all.\n\u201cApologies to all of you for the abrupt transfer,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cI am very limited on time. I will answer your questions, after which I hope you will spread explanations to the others.\u201d\n\u201cHow can we explain anything if we die of fright, hmmm?\u201d Gesha turned to Lindon\u2019s father. \u201cWhat did you teach this boy?\u201d\nJaran looked over, revealing the pinkish-white color of his restored eyes. \u201cApologies on behalf of my son, Fisher.\u201d\n\u201cTch.\u201d She waved a hand. \u201cQuiet. I know you didn\u2019t teach him anything.\u201d\nEven in midair, Lindon\u2019s father shuffled uncomfortably.\n[Oh no, your family isn\u2019t getting along with Fisher Gesha,] Dross said. [What a pity that is. Can you feel my pity?]\nLindon looked to the Redmoon Emissary. \u201cArchlady, I\u2019ll address your concerns first.\u201d Not only was she the highest-ranking one here, but she was also the one he personally cared about the least. Best to get rid of her first.\n\u201cThank you\u2026Monarch?\u201d\n\u201cSage will do.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Sage. The Hall has been working closely with your Twin Star Sect, as instructed, but many among my number are\u2026uncomfortable with the current circumstances.

Of course, we are grateful for your protection, and I know my people will feel more confident knowing you can repel an attack from a Monarch.\u201d\n\u201cYerin is in isolated training, but she has not forgotten you. When she emerges, which I expect will be soon, she will be as strong as I am currently.\u201d\nOr so Lindon hoped.\nIn fact, Yerin had grumbled more than once about Redmoon Hall attaching itself to her, but she would indeed blame herself if anything happened to them.

Do you expect any further\u2026disturbances\u2026anytime soon?\u201d\nDross answered that one. [We\u2019re hoping we sent a strong enough message this time. But we doubt it.]\nLindon agreed. Even if Reigan Shen stayed away, out of fear of the Silent King Bow, the other Monarchs were still likely to bother him.\nKahn Mala thanked him again, and Lindon sent her back. He turned to Cassias, who spoke without preamble.\n\u201cThe people of Serpent\u2019s Grave have heard about the Empty Ghost,\u201d Cassias said. \u201cThere are those who are calling the Twin Star Sect a Dreadgod cult. Especially given our recent company.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t have to gesture to indicate Redmoon Hall.\n\u201cWhat do you think, Cassias?\u201d Lindon asked. He had the Arelius bloodline legacy, and he had known Lindon well enough. His own testimony should carry weight with the refugees from the Blackflame Empire.\nThe Truegold sighed. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Lindon. I need you to tell me. Are you a Dreadgod?\u201d\nLindon couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on why, but that hurt to hear.\n\u201cI am borrowing the power of the Dreadgods to defeat them,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cBy the time I\u2019m done, there will be no Dreadgods left in the world.\u201d\nCassias\u2019 eyes pierced Lindon deeply, scanning him even without spiritual perception. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether to be proud of you or sad for you.\u201d\nGesha snorted.\n[How about both?] Dross suggested.\n\u201cI will tell them that I saw you with my own eyes and that you\u2019re fighting for us,\u201d Cassias went on. He hesitated before adding, \u201cFor what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m sorry. We should never have let you carry so much responsibility. I\u2019m just\u2026sorry.\u201d\nLindon gave him a smile he hoped was reassuring. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\nCassias sighed. \u201cGood luck, Lindon.\u201d\nLindon sent him back and turned to Fisher Gesha.\n\u201cI just wanted your permission to use the Soulsmithing facilities in those tunnels! Not so urgent, was it, hm? Not something you needed to summon me into the sky over!\u201d\n\u201cApologies, once again, Fisher. Of course you have my permission. I will give you better warning next time.\u201d\nGesha peered at him through her mask of wrinkles. \u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that, you hear me? There will be a next time. You\u2019d better make sure you\u2019re around, and not killed fighting Monarchs in the sky, or I\u2019ll find your Remnant and beat some sense into it myself.\u201d\nLindon promised before he sent her away. She disappeared while still grumbling.\n[You think I should tell her that Dreadgods don\u2019t leave Remnants?] Dross wondered idly. Lindon highly doubted that would help.\nThe two young women in the Twin Star Sect colors were next. Kelsa drew herself up, almost as tall as Lindon, though she stood on nothing.\nShe gave him her usual intense focus. \u201cThe Sect is worried.

And in his backing.\n\u201cDo you still have the resources I left?\u201d Lindon asked.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need resources. They need a leader.\u201d\n\u201cThey have the Sage\u2019s sister.\u201d\nKelsa stiffened again, her foxfire tail standing out straight, and there was heat in her voice. \u201cI can\u2019t lead! I\u2019m a Lowgold!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need you to instruct them on their advancement, and I don\u2019t need you to defend them. I need someone I can trust speaking for me. Do you agree?\u201d\nHis sister struggled inwardly, but she was honest even with herself. She grudgingly conceded. \u201cFine, but you owe me a present when you come back. Make me a weapon.\u201d\n\u201cDone,\u201d Lindon agreed. \u201cDross.\u201d\n[On it!] Dross coughed once and then transmitted into the minds of the more advanced members of the Twin Star Sect. [Wei Shi Kelsa, sister of the Void Sage, speaks with his voice. Listen to her until he comes back. And to me, Dross, your most reliable guardian.]\nMost of the Twin Star Sect would have little idea who Dross was, as the spirit hadn\u2019t been conscious for most of the time Lindon had spent leading them, but they would figure it out.\nThe number of people saying Lindon\u2019s name doubled.\nLindon sent his sister back and intended to transport Jai Chen as well, but she stopped him hurriedly. \u201cUh, sorry, I had something else.\u201d She scratched the side of her face in what he took as a nervous gesture. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have bothered you, I know you\u2019re busy, but I didn\u2019t know who else to ask. You were the one helping me with my Path.\u201d\nJai Chen\u2019s Path was special, being primarily a blend of Stellar Spear, Grasping Sky, and Hollow King madra, uniquely combined by means of a hunger artifact. She had a hard time finding aura to cycle.\n\u201cOh, do you need more natural treasures?\u201d Mentally, Lindon went over the inventory he\u2019d brought. His primary void key would have plenty of treasures in it, but this was a backup.\n\u201cNo, I can hit Highgold eventually, I just wanted to go\u2026faster than that.\u201d She shifted in the grip of the wind, then met his eyes. \u201cI can\u2019t help thinking that, if I was as strong as my brother was, I could have saved him.\u201d\nFingerling made a crooning sound.\nLindon felt a faint shadow of guilt. He could have protected Jai Long, had that been a higher priority. On the other hand, the man had been killed by the attack of a Dreadgod. Lindon didn\u2019t blame himself too much.\nHe considered for a moment, then stretched out one hand and called to the labyrinth. A moment later, a long, white, scripted spear appeared in his Dreadgod hand.\nHe had to wrestle Subject One\u2019s arm into submission to stop it from devouring the weapon immediately.\n\u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d Lindon asked.\nEyes wide, she nodded.\nHe flipped the weapon to her. Fingerling dipped out of the way as she caught it. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a way to purge incompatible madra, so you\u2019ll need to make sure the aspects are compatible before you drain anything with it. This is a Truegold weapon, and I can find you a better one eventually.\u201d\nTears welled up as she hugged the spear to herself. Lindon had never thought much of Jai Long, but sympathy still squeezed his heart at the sight of her pain.\nShe bowed to him. \u201cThank you.

I\u2019ll honor the Sect with it.\u201d\nLindon was considering her personal development more than her impact on the Sect, but he returned the gesture and sent her back.\n[Wow, your sister is going to hate that,] Dross pointed out. [Didn\u2019t you just give Jai Chen everything Kelsa wanted?]\nLindon winced as he realized that was true, but he\u2019d make it up to Kelsa later. He turned to his father and braced himself.\n\u201cYou called for me?\u201d he asked mildly. The moment Jaran said something critical or cutting, Lindon intended to toss him back and leave.\n[Drop him,] Dross suggested.\nJaran gripped his cane, shifted on his cushion of wind, and looked here and there with his replacement eyes. Finally, he muttered, \u201cI just wanted to see how you were.\u201d\nLindon hovered in place for too long. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cBig fight and everything. Seemed like a lot, even for an Overlord. A man can wonder about his son.\u201d\nLindon considered pointing out that he wasn\u2019t an Overlord anymore, but he pressed his fists together instead. \u201cGratitude, Father.\u201d\nJaran grumbled to himself, then shoved his cane in Lindon\u2019s direction. \u201cBe safe, all right? No sense in being the bravest on the battlefield if you don\u2019t make it home.\u201d\nLindon felt lost. \u201cYes, I\u2026I will.\u201d\n[All right, fine,] Dross said.

I can hear it in your thoughts.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t. Dross wouldn\u2019t let you.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s my inside man.\u201d\nDross popped out and drifted behind Yerin. [She\u2019s lying, of course. She\u2019s never asked me. For some reason.]\nYerin turned to look at the spirit. \u201cWait, would you really\u2026\u201d\n[I\u2019m not saying yes or no, I\u2019m just saying you should ask sometime. When\u2026] Dross mouthed Lindon\u2019s name. [\u2026isn\u2019t\u2026] Dross mouthed the word \u201clistening.\u201d\n\u201cYour stealth needs work,\u201d Lindon said.\nYerin hopped off his back and whirled around in front of him, excited. \u201cHow about the bow? Did it make Shen scurry?\u201d\n\u201cWith his tail between his legs.\u201d\nYerin clicked her tongue. \u201cWould have given my left leg to see that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s heavy,\u201d Lindon admitted, \u201clike using a weapon too big for me. It might be easier for Mercy once she\u2019s ready, especially if she has the support of the Bow Icon.\u201d\nMercy, who was leaning out the second story of their barracks, hit the back of her head on the window frame. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m not there yet! Touching an Icon is not as easy as you made it look.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s almost there,\u201d Yerin said confidently.\n\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be taking her pick of Sage or Herald. Can\u2019t lie and say I\u2019m not concerned about Orthos and Blue, but I don\u2019t have an ounce of worry about her.\u201d\n\u201cWorry about me!\u201d\nLindon enjoyed the conversation and let himself relax, but he heard the subtext of the conversation. Yerin was expressing confidence in Mercy so firmly because she was worried.\nWhile Mercy had the smoothest road to the peak of Archlord, she still hadn\u2019t recovered from the emotional impact of fighting her mother. That could be just as much of an obstacle as a spiritual injury, and one that Lindon had no idea how to heal.\nYerin gave him the ghost of a smile like she could sense his thoughts.\n[You see?] Dross said. [It\u2019s convenient when she can read your mind. I don\u2019t have to share everything, just some\u2026choice selections.]\n\u201cYou and I were sparring when I left,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cI thought we\u2019d pick up where we left off.\u201d\nShe looped her arm around his and pulled him into the sparring hall. \u201cWorked a few things out, when the Remnant lets me off my leash. Wanted to get your eyes on them anyway.\u201d\nLindon reached out to the pocket world\u2019s controls and turned the time-warping back up. The pressure of their deadline still loomed over him, but that wasn\u2019t the only reason he wanted to spend as long in here as possible.\nOnly now did he feel like he had finally come home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nOutpost 01: Oversight\n\n\nIn the back of his mind, Makiel observed the engagement between the Mad King and the two Judges as best he could.

There was little enough to see, with the general chaos of the Way and the lockdown that Daruman had put on the Sector.\nEven with the observational authority of the Hound, the most Makiel could catch were a few glimpses and half-accurate predictions. It was like trying to watch an entire battlefield through a keyhole and a haze of smoke.\nBut that wasn\u2019t his primary focus. Most of his powers were bent toward scouring the stretches of the Way over which he still ruled. He drifted inside his own headquarters, within the arctic air of the world he\u2019d created.\nThis place enhanced his sight. A mortal watching would see purple screens flickering in and out of existence around him, each a glimpse of the past, present, or future of a thousand different worlds.\nThe reality behind that sight was even more complex, and Makiel found his mind and authority stretched to their limits.\nWhere was the Reaper\u2019s Scythe?\nHe had spent years combing the worlds for the weapon, to no avail. But now was his chance. When faced with destruction, Ozriel had reached out for his Scythe. As Makiel had known he would.\nThat cry hadn\u2019t reached the weapon, but echoes of it had still escaped the Sector. Makiel could use those echoes to find the Scythe himself, while Ozriel was tied up in battle.\nAt least, in theory.\nEvery lead he\u2019d chased down had turned cold. Intuitively, he felt that he was close, but he still turned up short.\nIf Makiel found the Scythe in time, he could achieve every objective perfectly. Daruman dead, Ozriel dead, and the Scythe in the hands of the Court.\nThough he had ruled over the greatest losses since the founding of the Abidan, Makiel would be satisfied if he accomplished those three things. He would, at least, leave behind a foundation from which the Court of Seven could rebuild. Greater than ever.\nAssuming he could find the Scythe.\nHis Presence, the eye floating over his shoulder, shouted a warning into his mind. A bright blue light had emerged from the murky darkness of the Mad King\u2019s battlefield. A burning fire of restoration.\nSuriel had made it free.\nMany of the screens around Makiel winked out as he abandoned most of the lower-priority lines of inquiry in order to focus on those with higher potential. His time was limited.\nHe had to finish before Suriel arrived.\nBut no matter how he searched, Makiel found nothing.\nSuriel rushed for him, inevitable as a blazing meteor. Hounds formed up around Oversight, sensing an incoming power and activating their defenses, and he felt their confusion when they realized the approaching threat was another Judge.\nMakiel willed them to stand down. In the end, he hadn\u2019t made it in time. His sight did not reach far enough.\nHe would have to settle for an imperfect victory.\nMakiel summoned his armor, sheathing himself in its white protection. The Sword of Makiel appeared in his hands, its point digging into the ground beneath him, power pulsing through its blade in veins of purple energy.\nThen he awaited the arrival of the Phoenix.\nShe did not request entry, instead crashing through the ice overhead, shattering it like a true meteorite. Though Makiel had foreseen this, it still hurt to see his sanctum violated.\nSuriel hovered over him, Razor in one hand and Mantle streaming in white flame behind her. Her own power stretched out like blue, fiery wings, and her purple eyes were alight with rage.\nShe pointed the Razor at him. \u201cOn the authority of the Sixth Judge, Suriel, I accuse you of conspiring against a fellow Judge of the Court.\u201d\n\u201cBy the authority of Makiel, I agree.\u201d\nHe found a small amount of satisfaction in the moment of silence that followed, broken only by the hiss of falling snow and ice.\n\u201cI accept my punishment,\u201d Makiel continued, \u201cand I go now to make amends.\u201d He began to rise into the air. \u201cContact the others. There will be much healing to do when I\u2019m gone.\u201d\nThe sigils in her eyes spun as she scanned the future, looking for the possibility that he was lying or luring her into a trap.\nShe was right to check, and he didn\u2019t bother to hide himself. He was telling the truth.\n\u201cExplain yourself,\u201d she demanded.\n\u201cI allowed Daruman\u2019s continued existence,\u201d Makiel said. \u201cI continued to rely on Ozriel for centuries when I should have stripped him of his authority.

I am responsible for much, and I will make amends if it costs me my life.\u201d\nSuriel\u2019s runic eyes finally caught sight of the Fate he was weaving, and he could feel her horror deepen. She did not agree with his designs. Then again, he hadn\u2019t expected she would.\n\u201cIf I survive, I will give up the Mantle of the Hound,\u201d he went on. \u201cBut I am willing to die as long as I take my mistakes with me.\u201d\nSuriel looked into the future and saw his plan.\nHe watched alongside her.\nThere were only two possible outcomes of Ozriel\u2019s battle with Daruman. They saw Daruman emerging from Vesper victorious. Or, with a much lower probability, perhaps Ozriel would be the one to survive. Neither would let the other live. And neither would achieve victory unscathed.\nIn either scenario, Makiel would be there waiting for them. With sword drawn.\nThe victor would be executed by the First Judge. Even if doing so crippled or killed Makiel, he would serve justice.\nMakiel lifted his sword. \u201cThis will be my last act as a Judge. I regret that I could not leave the Scythe behind, but whoever takes my Mantle after me must be the one to find it.\u201d\n\u201cI will not allow this,\u201d Suriel said quietly.\n\u201cWhy not? Odds are, the one I go to execute will be the Mad King.\u201d\n\u201cThere is nothing just about this. This is\u2026sickness.\u201d\nMakiel was starting to get irritated. Suriel had made such decisions herself. \u201cWhen I\u2019m done, the sources of infection will be gone. All three of us.\u201d\nSuriel\u2019s brow furrowed as she scanned Fate, searching for something. \u201cWhy did you wait for me?\u201d\n\u201cIn every scenario, you came here looking for me.\u201d\nShe made an expression that, even with all his advantages, he couldn\u2019t read. \u201cLooking for you?\u201d\n\u201cSometimes you stand aside, and sometimes I must go through you. Either way, let us be done with it here.\u201d If she couldn\u2019t see that much, she wasn\u2019t as skilled of a Hound as Makiel had thought.\nThis time, Makiel could read her face. Suriel radiated pity.\n\u201cYou still have the same blind spot. I\u2019m not here for you.\u201d Suriel held out a hand. \u201cCome to me,\u201d she whispered.\nAnd the ice beneath Makiel\u2019s feet began to crack.\nDarkness spilled up from the ground, and sick anger twisted Makiel\u2019s gut. Now that she\u2019d broken the veil, he could feel the weapon beneath him. The one that Ozriel had buried here, in the center of the Hound\u2019s power, so long ago.\nAt Suriel\u2019s call, the Scythe of Ozriel rose from the ice and drifted into her hand.\nIt looked the same as his imitation Scythes had: like a slice of darkness itself forged into metal. But even in the Mad King\u2019s hands, the fake weapon had never had the same weight to it. This one was aware of Makiel\u2019s presence and its disdain radiated like heat.\nThough the Scythe drifted past him, Makiel didn\u2019t dare reach out to touch it. The weapon was looking for an excuse to kill him.\nWith Ozriel\u2019s veil gone, Makiel could now see the threads of Fate that had been hidden before. Suriel intended to return to Vesper with the Scythe, with or without Makiel. If she made it back in time, they could turn the tables on the Mad King.\nShe held the Scythe in one hand, though its authority clashed with hers. Ozriel may have lent it to her, which was why the Scythe tolerated her touch, but she was still no Reaper. She couldn\u2019t unleash the full force of Ozriel\u2019s weapon.\nThe fact that he had lent out his Scythe at all shocked Makiel.

Instead, he had hidden it.\nBeneath Makiel\u2019s home.\n\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d Suriel asked quietly.\nMakiel watched the possibilities spill out into the future. He saw Fate split and twist, fork and turn.\nThe power to decide the future now rested on him. This was the responsibility of Makiel, the Hound.\nHe saw clearly what he would have to do.\nThe odds of reaching Ozriel in time now were slim, next to impossible. As fast as Suriel had made it here, it would be absurd for her to make it back before Ozriel\u2019s death. Makiel had to be prepared to face the Mad King, which meant he needed the Scythe.\nAnd Suriel wouldn\u2019t give it to him. Those possibilities were so small, so remote, that they weren\u2019t worth considering. He would have to strike her down, leaving her alive if possible, and then contact Zakariel\u2014\nHis thoughts were cut off when Suriel reversed the Scythe and held it out to him.\nThe weapon struggled in her grip, but she held it with a firm will. \u201cEnough.

Just a glance at any of them gave him a headache, but the second one was more tolerable than the others.\nTherefore, that was the one he activated the most.\nIts form was rock-solid but hard to grasp. It was as though the symbol shifted before his eyes, though he knew the rune wasn\u2019t changing its shape. His eyes kept sliding around it.\nThe symbol reminded him of a shield, or a castle wall, though it looked very little like either. It was a comfort, like catching sight of a safe haven while being chased by monsters.\nZiel felt a sharp pain in his eye and had to look away, blinking rapidly to clear his vision. Even as an Archlord again, it was all he could do to gaze on the symbol for a few seconds at a time. This wasn\u2019t its full power, either; no depiction of Lindon\u2019s could carry the total significance of the original. Not unless Lindon comprehended it fully.\nHe leaned back against the wall, cycling madra to soothe his eyes. Once he was back to good condition, he would try again.\nAnd again and again. As many times as it took.\nThe Weeping Dragon was on its way.\nThey had to slay it themselves, which was the first impossible task. He had faced the burning sky of the storm Dreadgod before, so he knew its power as well as anyone.\nAfter that, they had to face down the Monarchs. The second impossible task.\nIf he wanted to do the impossible, he couldn\u2019t shy away from a little pain.\nZiel needed to comprehend as much of these truths as he could. To avoid distraction, he\u2019d set up walls of Forged madra. It was a temporary shelter, little more than a box, but it would prevent the others from bothering him.\nIn theory.\nThere was a polite knock at the panel of madra that served as a door, though the knock was only a courtesy. Ziel was doing nothing to veil his spirit, so he could sense Lindon outside as well as Lindon could sense him.\n\u201cPardon the interruption, but would you help me for a moment?\u201d Lindon called.\nZiel deactivated the Path of Heaven and shoved his way out of the shelter. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask. You\u2019re the boss here.\u201d\nLindon stood taller than Ziel\u2019s little shelter, and he wore an apologetic look that was spoiled by his burning, inhuman eyes. Those eyes widened into an expression that would have, on someone else, looked like embarrassment.\n\u201cIf you were too busy, I could have come back later.\u201d\n\u201cHave you heard of being too polite?\u201d\nLindon dipped his head. \u201cApologies.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t wrong that Lindon acted so respectfully. In fact, it was probably a good thing. But it still irritated Ziel from time to time. \u201cDo you know what it feels like when you can punch Monarchs and Dreadgods but you bow your head to me?\u201d\n\u201cWhat does it feel like?\u201d Lindon asked, and Ziel got the impression he was genuinely curious.\n\u201cIt feels like you\u2019re mocking me.\u201d\n\u201cPardon, but that\u2019s not my intention.\u201d\n\u201cI know. That makes it worse.\u201d\nLindon\u2019s black-and-white Dreadgod eyes blinked as he visibly processed the words, and Ziel sighed. \u201cNever mind. Take me wherever you were taking me.\u201d\nLindon spread his left hand and gestured for Ziel to join him at his side, which gave Ziel another jolt of irritation. He really was incapable of throwing his weight around, wasn\u2019t he?\nThen Ziel remembered Lindon drifting into Shatterspine Castle, levitating the entire building while suppressing a Herald\u2019s Remnant.\nNo, he was capable of acting his advancement level. He just chose not to.\nZiel thought back to his own time at the head of the Dawnwing Sect. He hadn\u2019t used his position to crush those beneath him, but then again, he hadn\u2019t lowered himself to their level either. Maybe he should have.\nIdle thoughts, and they didn\u2019t distract him much. Lindon asked polite questions about his progress as they walked, which Ziel answered with one- or two-word responses.\nThey headed underground, through marble tunnels and into a cave which Lindon had sealed off with both scripts and a layered wall of earth madra Forged to resemble golden metal. The wall melted away as Lindon activated a construct, and they both walked through.\nInside, there was a small cylindrical tank\u2014roughly the size of a large dog\u2014surrounded by other devices, elixirs, and constructs.

The liquid was pinkish-purple and clear, shimmering in the light.\nAs the fluid filled up the tank, five objects floated upward. They were tiny balls of white madra, so dense with the aspect of dreams that they made Ziel flinch back. His spiritual sense tingled in their presence, and he had to veil himself to stop his thoughts from spinning into some kind of delusion.\n\u201cApologies, I should have warned you.\u201d Despite his words, Lindon looked fine.\nZiel pointed to the tank. \u201cAre those pieces of the Dreadgod?\u201d\n[They were,] Dross said cheerily. [Now they have been processed and combined with some of my own, less-potent-but-still-impressive madra. They\u2019re beautiful little seeds that just need watering. Isn\u2019t that right, little seeds? Yes, you just need water, don\u2019t you? Don\u2019t you?]\nHe resumed humming to the seeds floating in the tank as he continued pouring fluid inside.\nLindon\u2019s Dreadgod arm flexed, and he opened and closed his fingers. Ziel didn\u2019t think he was aware of doing it, but the presence of the Silent King\u2019s modified madra must have been stimulating the arm\u2019s hunger aspect.\n\u201cSo these are mental enhancements,\u201d Ziel said.\n\u201cThey will be. I\u2019d love to make a mind-spirit like Dross for each of you, but I think it might be more reasonable to give you some of his benefits. We have to alter the madra before it\u2019s suitable to use as materials, though, and the only method I\u2019m aware of takes many years.\u201d Lindon turned to Ziel. \u201cThat\u2019s where I thought you might come in.\u201d\nZiel wasn\u2019t sure he could do as much. His experiments with the Rune Queen\u2019s array were still just beginning, and doing this inside a time-warped pocket world was risky. He was afraid of rocking the boat, so to speak.\nBut instead of voicing his concerns, he activated the Grand Oath Array.\nProfound silver runes appeared around him, Forged by his Divine Treasure and controlled according to the method he\u2019d inherited from Shatterspine Castle.\nZiel moved the circle to surround the tank. \u201cI can try to speed up time\u2019s effect on the target. How do we tell if it works?\u201d\nLindon Forged a scale quickly and carelessly. It was stable enough to remain a blue-white coin of blue madra, but not so stable that it would last long. He flipped it onto the ground, and Ziel included it in the targeting of the Oath Array.\n[Wait!] Dross protested. [I\u2019m not ready!] He tilted a pitcher almost completely upside-down, until the last trickles of amethyst liquid dripped out into the tank.\nAfter one\u2026two\u2026three slow drips, Ziel was certain he was finished. But Dross still waited for a fourth drop before he spun away from the container. [There! Ready!]\nLindon gestured, and a lid flew up and screwed itself into place.

He\u2019d overshot.", "f9404797-86c8-44f4-948b-f5e0fa618e5c": "But Dross still waited for a fourth drop before he spun away from the container. [There! Ready!]\nLindon gestured, and a lid flew up and screwed itself into place. Scripts flickered as they were sealed shut.\nWhen that was in place, Ziel operated the Array. He concentrated on accelerating the tank\u2019s time by just one day, though he knew his precise control was lacking.\nThe silver script spun faster and faster, until it was just a blur.\nThe tank didn\u2019t change much to the outside eye, though he did feel as though the spiritual patterns inside were settling quickly.

He\u2019d overshot. He should practice more.\n\u201cBetter more time than less.\u201d Lindon frowned into the tank, and Ziel wondered what he was thinking about. Maybe he was realizing how much potential the Grand Oath Array had if only Ziel could control it more precisely.\nDross drifted up to Lindon\u2019s face. [You have thoughts. I taste them. Share them with me.]\n\u201cThe pocket world held up well, so I just wondered\u2026\u201d Lindon glanced to Ziel. \u201cDo you think you could use this on one of us?\u201d\nZiel picked up the idea immediately. \u201cOnly if you want to stand inside the circle for a day. You wouldn\u2019t be able to cycle aura.\u201d\n\u201cBut your body keeps working.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019d process elixirs.\u201d\nZiel considered the idea. He was pushing toward peak Archlord as fast as he dared, and they had plenty of elixirs and resources, but the spirit could only go so fast. Just like the body needed time to build muscle.\nAt peak Archlord, he\u2019d be able to sense Icons more clearly. He might even be able to endure looking at the Abidan symbols for longer. Could he really force open the secrets of the universe so easily?\n\u201cWorth a shot,\u201d he said. Without further delay, he spread the silver circles around himself.\nThen he accelerated time again, just as he\u2019d done for the tank. But this time, from his perspective, the runes didn\u2019t seem to change their speed. It was the outside world that slowed down.\nLindon and Dross were virtually frozen, though Ziel felt normal. There was no instability in the Array or in the pocket world around him.\nNothing to do now but wait.\nCycling his madra internally worked, but he couldn\u2019t touch any aura outside the circle. He couldn\u2019t open his void key\u2014it resisted him, and he didn\u2019t want to force it. Best not to mess with time and space too much.\nThis would certainly work for processing elixirs. He could even read dream tablets or meditate on the Abidan symbols.\nBut there had to be some limitations. Otherwise, Monarchs wouldn\u2019t need to spend so many resources to create time-warped pocket dimensions.\nHe gave it another few minutes and then slowed the operation of the Array, syncing it to time outside once again. \u201cIt works,\u201d he said.\nLindon\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cI\u2019d like to try, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\nZiel shrugged. Why not?\nThe instant the silver runes appeared around Lindon, the entire pocket world screamed in protest.\nZiel cut off the Grand Oath Array immediately, but the substance of space had shivered. The ground pitched to one side, and Dross screamed in Ziel\u2019s mind.\nYerin appeared before the shaking settled down, leaving the wall of Forged earth madra broken in her wake. Her sword was out, and she scanned the room for the cause of the disruption.\nLindon lifted his left hand. \u201cApologies for the disturbance. We won\u2019t try that again.\u201d\nYerin let out a breath and slammed her sword back into its sheath. \u201cYou shaved off half my lifeline! Thought we were all about to crumble to dust!\u201d\nLindon gathered her up in his arms and continued his apology, so Ziel ignored them and returned to the problem at hand. Dross drifted up, one tendril on his chin as though deep in thought.\n\u201cLindon\u2019s too much for the Array,\u201d Ziel said.\n[He\u2019s too much for anyone. But yes, I wouldn\u2019t try it on him again while we\u2019re stuck in here.]\n\u201cThen why did it work for me?\u201d\n[I\u2019m going to guess\u2014and it is a guess, so don\u2019t tear me to pieces and scatter me to the winds if it\u2019s not correct.

I think you just need practice. Using it on yourself is easy, using it on someone else is hard, at least without shaking this tiny world to pieces. Using it on Lindon is very hard. Focus on making the power your own. Right now, you\u2019re trying to walk with someone else\u2019s legs.]\nDross manifested disproportionately large human legs and mimed walking to support the analogy, which was disgusting enough to make Ziel look away.\n\u201cBut it will keep working for me?\u201d\nDross spread his tendrils in a shrug. [Worked once, didn\u2019t it? Why not try it another time or twelve?]\nLindon joined them a minute later. He had heard their exchange\u2014or Dross had filled him in mentally\u2014but Ziel had some thoughts of his own.\n\u201cGet me all the elixirs I could process in a year,\u201d Ziel said.\n\u201cA year?\u201d Lindon asked. \u201cIf you\u2019re stuck in the Array for a year, you\u2019ll go insane.\u201d\nZiel shrugged. \u201cNot like I have to do it all at once. If I need to, I\u2019ll cancel the technique.\u201d\nNot that he intended to. He\u2019d heard of Monarchs cycling for years at a time, and if he had to do that to make the most of their time, he would.\nLindon traded glances with Dross. Ziel didn\u2019t sense anything, but he got the impression that they were having an entire conversation in a second.\n\u201cTwo conditions,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cFirst, we\u2019ll ease into it. Start with a few days, then a week, then a month. We want to be sure you can handle it, and that we don\u2019t destabilize the world\u2019s time.\u201d\nThe more experiments they performed, the more likely that was, but Ziel nodded anyway. If it started looking dangerous, they could always abort.\n\u201cSecond, let us put you to sleep.\u201d\nZiel scratched the base of his horns. \u201cYou\u2019re worried about me cracking under the pressure?\u201d\n[That\u2019s not the way we would put it! But yes, yeah, absolutely. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re worried about.]\nLindon met Ziel\u2019s eyes, and his tone was polite as ever. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you might stick it out for the entire duration and sustain mental exhaustion that even you aren\u2019t aware of.\u201d\n\u201cI could always use the Array however I want when you aren\u2019t around to supervise me,\u201d Ziel pointed out.\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Lindon said.\nZiel hesitated for a moment before nodding.\nLindon opened a void key and began another silent conversation with Dross. It looked like they were trying to decide which elixirs to begin with. Or perhaps rationing them.\nFor one stupid moment, Ziel considered that Lindon might not have a whole year\u2019s worth of elixirs for him.\nA broad drinking horn of bone drifted out of the void key, blood visibly sloshing from within but restricted by a script. The metallic stench was overpowering, and it radiated a sense of enduring strength.\n\u201cThe Thousand Blood Elixir,\u201d Lindon introduced. \u201cDistilled from a thousand of the most physically powerful sacred beasts, condensed and refined to let a Sage artificially match a Herald in strength. For a moment, at least, and assuming their body can handle the burden. Stolen from the Beast King.\u201d\n[\u201cStolen,\u201d] Dross repeated. [A vulture dropped it on top of us.]\nSilently, Ziel thanked his mentor. He reached out for the horn, but Lindon pulled it back.\nSomething else was drifting out of the void key.\n\u201cThe Spring of Celestial Starlight. Nourishes the spirits of Archlords to prepare the Remnants for Herald.\u201d This was a crystal-bright sphere containing a blue liquid that Ziel would bet had been refined from a Tear of the Deep, the ultimate water-aspect natural treasure.\n[You get half.", "d7dd8f5b-1fdb-4140-bfe3-f5a62998f293": "\u201cThe Thousand Blood Elixir,\u201d Lindon introduced. \u201cDistilled from a thousand of the most physically powerful sacred beasts, condensed and refined to let a Sage artificially match a Herald in strength.

The rest is for Little Blue.]\nZiel reached out a second time, but a third object floated out.\nThis was a golden pill, trapped in six layers of cages, each made of a different metal. Ziel sensed nothing from this at all; at least, nothing that escaped the scripts. \u201cHeart of the Earth Emperor. Stolen from the Ninecloud Court, this pill is made to help Monarchs control and focus their physical strength.\u201d\nZiel didn\u2019t reach out this time, but he found himself a little intimidated by the sight of the three. No matter what he\u2019d stolen from the Monarchs, these had to be three of the best items. Would he have any left for the others?\nA fourth elixir flew out. This container somewhat resembled an hourglass and was filled with a bright, violently orange fluid that gave him the spiritual impression of strong acid.\n\u201cAn unexpected gain from Reigan Shen\u2019s vault,\u201d Lindon said, with a satisfied smile. \u201cThe Inner Light Tempering elixir is intended to reinforce madra channels and promote spiritual resilience even in highly advanced sacred beasts.\u201d\n[Not recommended for human use,] Dross pointed out. [And not fun to cycle.]\nThe void key closed. Rather than commenting on the rarity and power of these treasures, Ziel focused on their purpose.\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re preparing me to take a beating,\u201d Ziel observed.\nLindon was carefully filling a syringe with the orange fluid of the Inner Light Tempering. The madra within surged and raged like a contained storm, and Ziel thought he even saw faces inside; elixirs at this level often developed a kind of rudimentary will.\n\u201cYou will need to take a beating,\u201d Lindon admitted, without taking his eyes from the syringe. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to take hits from Monarchs and Dreadgods. But you\u2019ll also need\u2026\u201d He finished filling the syringe and brought it over to Ziel. \u201c\u2026to hit back.\u201d\nZiel strapped himself onto a table Lindon had summoned. He leaned back with his arms tied down; nothing he couldn\u2019t break, but it was meant to contain him while he slept.\nLindon pushed the needle into him and injected the solution. It raged through his veins in seconds, and Ziel\u2019s muscles tightened up involuntarily.\nThe empty syringe was visibly warped from its brief contact with the Inner Light Tempering elixir, and aura around it bent strangely, which disturbed Ziel. That stuff was now in his veins.\nLindon incinerated the ruined syringe with Blackflame when he noticed Ziel looking. \u201cYou\u2019ll miss a little willpower training by sleeping through this, but nothing important. This functions more like a poison, teaching your body to resist the burden of excess spiritual power.\u201d\n[Like when you\u2019re using a weapon too powerful for you, for instance,] Dross put in.\nPain wracked Ziel\u2019s entire body, but nothing he wasn\u2019t used to. When Dross\u2019 words sank in, Ziel eyed Lindon.\n\u201cYou\u2019re preparing me for a weapon? Isn\u2019t that optimistic?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s trust,\u201d Lindon said. Then he took a step back. \u201cThree days to start with, I think.\u201d\nIt was hard to concentrate on the Grand Oath Array with the painful elixir burning his veins, but Ziel manifested the silver runes. Before he activated them, Dross drifted up to his head.\n[Sweet dreams,] Dross whispered, tapping his forehead. [By which I mean I have ensured that you will dream about delicious desserts. You\u2019re welcome.]\nIn his last, fading thoughts before he passed out, Ziel activated the Array for what he estimated would be three days.\nThe world outside slowed as he, the table he was strapped to, and the tank of mind-constructs at his feet were all pushed forward three days.\nHe did, indeed, dream of cake.", "1ae6ed83-a760-4e41-aee8-e98e50b9e976": "When Dross\u2019 words sank in, Ziel eyed Lindon.\n\u201cYou\u2019re preparing me for a weapon?

The first time she\u2019d visited for training purposes since she was a Gold.\nThe first page wasn\u2019t much. At least, not by her standards now. It was a large room filled with a black spider\u2019s web. She had to climb the web and make it from one end of the room to the other, pursued by crystalline amethyst Remnants that resembled spiders.\nLindon strode up next to her, his spiritual sense filling the entire space. \u201cIncredible,\u201d he said. \u201cI can only imagine the Soulsmithing expertise that went into this.\u201d\n\u201cBreak it down,\u201d Mercy said decisively.\nHe hesitated. \u201cAre you sure? If we leave it intact, you\u2019ll still have a cleaner road to Herald than anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cYou said this was faster, right?\u201d\nMalice\u2019s will and memories were in every page of the Book of Eternal Night. If Mercy continued to follow her usual Path of Seven Pages, she would reach the peak of Archlord with her spirit prepared for Herald.\nBut not soon enough. She needed to steal more of her mother\u2019s power, faster.\nA spider crawled up to Lindon\u2019s feet, but he glanced at it, and the spirit scurried away. \u201cThere are other ways. If you do this, you\u2019ll have to defeat her will. You risk turning yourself into a second copy of her.\u201d\nMercy\u2019s Overlord revelation whispered into her mind. \u201cI am not Malice. I am Mercy.\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said aloud. Though she did add, \u201cBut let\u2019s take it one page at a time, all right?\u201d\n\u201cCan you help her, Dross?\u201d Lindon asked.\nThe spirit spun out next to Lindon\u2019s head. His eye traced the entire space. [Hey, I like it in here! Nice colors. Anyway, there\u2019s not much I can do for you, Mercy. This place is inside you, so how am I supposed to slip in between you? You\u2019re not Lindon.]\nMercy steeled herself. She felt like she might cry, but she had never been more resolved. Her mother had betrayed her, and the time Mercy had spent since then had not healed the wound. \u201cI\u2019ll never be in a better condition to resist Malice\u2019s will than I am now.\u201d\nLindon gave a nod and raised his right hand.\nMadra slithered out from him in a web she could barely detect. It was too scattered and rough to be called a real technique. More like a method of moving madra around. But he spread pure madra, Blackflame, and hunger out in a complicated web into the page.\nShe winced in discomfort as she felt the Book of Eternal Night trembling.\n[Each page is really its own, separate construct,] Dross told her. [We\u2019ll have to go through the pages one by one and break them down, and then you integrate the powers into your spirit on your own. It shouldn\u2019t be too bad for you; everything here is compatible with your spirit. Not like Lindon! Do you know how many times he\u2019s Consumed something that could have destroyed his whole soul? I\u2019ll tell you\u2026]\nWhile Dross continued, the first page of the Book of Eternal Night crumbled around them.\nEach fragment torn out of the space dissolved into her spirit. The contents of the room, she could handle; this page was made for Lowgolds, after all. But when chunks of the walls collapsed and vanished into her, she grunted and almost lost her concentration.\nShe wasn\u2019t physically inside the Book, after all.

But the sudden influx of her mother\u2019s willpower had shaken her.\nThe contents of the room were made with power appropriate to a Lowgold, but the structure of the room itself wasn\u2019t. It was made from a Monarch\u2019s power.\nIf the Book hadn\u2019t been squeezed down to fit compatibly into Mercy\u2019s spirit, just that taste of Malice\u2019s madra would have burst her from the inside out.\nAs it was, Mercy felt another person wrestling for control of her spirit. A voiceless, formless force of determination. A will that would conquer rather than surrender.\nAkura Malice.\n\u201cHold on,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cThere\u2019s more coming.\u201d\nMercy braced herself again.\nShe cycled the madra that flowed through her, stored the occasional spark of soulfire, and vented excess power by letting techniques fly wildly into the real world. That much was easy in itself, but it was made much harder when she had to do it while also fighting against Malice\u2019s will.\nHalf-formed memories and spikes of powerful emotion swept over Mercy in a wave. Irritation. Determination. Grief. Resolve.\nProtective love for a family. Hatred for those who would threaten that family.\nThat isn\u2019t so bad, is it? Mercy thought, and she couldn\u2019t tell if it was her own voice or not. Dedicating myself to the family. That\u2019s a good thing!\nBy the time the last of the room collapsed around her and the first page dissolved, Mercy was panting and sweating. She held on by a hair, enduring the river of foreign thoughts and sorting the spiritual powers.\nThe operation was over, but her spirit was still a storm of darkness and chaos. Her thoughts were no better, swirling around in circles and hiding her identity.\nBut she wouldn\u2019t give in. She needed this to defeat her mother. She would not give up, and that resolve resonated both with her own soul and with the foreign will inside her.\nMercy had just decided to settle her spirit, even if it killed her, when she felt a hand on her shoulder.\nA moment later, pure madra trickled into her like a soothing rain. The chaos in her soul settled slightly, the pressure on her mind lightened, and even her mother\u2019s willpower stopped hitting so hard.\n\u201cPardon,\u201d Lindon said quietly. \u201cThat was a little too much to ask.\u201d\nMercy wanted to sigh in relief, but she needed to finish this before she said anything. Lindon withdrew his hand and his madra, and while he had brought the difficulty down to her level, he hadn\u2019t solved the problem for her.\nAfter another five minutes of wrestling herself, Mercy opened her eyes and shuddered. \u201cThanks. There were more memories than I expected.\u201d\nLindon stood over her, a silent support, but Dross drifted down to look into her face. [What memories? Not that you need to tell me! Not while Lindon\u2019s around to listen, anyway. I\u2019m very curious. Get out of here, Lindon!]\n\u201cDo you know anything about my father?\u201d Mercy asked. She looked to Dross, but she was asking both of them. Lindon had spent a long time researching in Akura territory. He might know more about her than she assumed.\n\u201cVery little,\u201d he said. \u201cHe isn\u2019t mentioned much in Moongrave.

Long enough to have me and Pride. Then she left.\u201d\n\u201cDid you\u2026know him?\u201d Lindon asked carefully.\nShe watched the darkness. \u201cWe visited a few times when I was young. I don\u2019t know how much Pride remembers. Uncle Fury liked our father a lot, so you can imagine what he was like. Always fighting somebody.\u201d\n[What kind of an unstable person would live like that?] Dross said, and even without looking up, Mercy was sure he was staring at Lindon.\n\u201cI was eight when he died,\u201d Mercy continued. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a plot against my mother or anything. Just another battle. My mother never talked to us about it. I thought she didn\u2019t care, and I wondered: \u2018What about if I died? Would she care then?\u2019\u201d\nLindon sat down opposite her, though he stayed quiet.\nDross drifted down as well. He opened his mouth to speak, but Lindon grabbed him. The spirit remained silent too.\nMercy didn\u2019t know how to stop the words. \u201cI just saw pieces of her memory. She\u2026enjoyed her time with him. She didn\u2019t want to leave, but she had to. For the family, and all that. When she found out my father died, Uncle Fury and Aunt Charity had to hold her back from blowing up the entire region. I never knew that.\u201d\nShe tucked her forehead into her knees. \u201cI wish she hadn\u2019t cared.\u201d\nMercy had been on the verge of casting her mother as a cold, unfeeling monster. If that were the truth, it would have been easier. She could hate Malice comfortably.\nThere was cruelty in her fragmented memories as well. Hatred, disdain, arrogance.\nBut that wasn\u2019t everything.\n\u201cI know the Monarchs aren\u2019t complete monsters,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cBut the Dreadgods are.\u201d\nShe looked to him, and he met her gaze with eyes that shone like white circles in the darkness.\nMercy rearranged herself into a cycling position. There was only one way to get rid of the Dreadgods.\n\u201cPage two, please!\u201d she said.\n[Your enthusiasm is great, it\u2019s wonderful, I love it, but don\u2019t you think it would be better to tackle this tomorrow? We want you to be in the best condition to\u2014]\n\u201cPage two,\u201d Mercy repeated.\n\u201cOpen,\u201d Lindon commanded. And the two of them slipped into the Book again.", "80f05a36-09b2-4a2f-a183-c68c916fbb93": "7\n\n\n\n\n\nYerin dashed up to Lindon and swung Netherclaw with the full force of her Steelborn Iron body. The body her master had chosen for her, which gave her great capacity for strength even compared to other Heralds.\nLindon swung Wavedancer in his Dreadgod arm. He used it physically instead of controlling it remotely with his madra, and his sword technique was rough.\nBut the impact of their two clashing blades sent them both flying backwards. The wide cave was unharmed\u2014this was a training room intended to be used by Monarchs\u2014but a lesser arena might have been destroyed.\nThey landed at the same time, and Lindon brought his sword up in anticipation of another strike.\nInstead, Yerin pointed at his arm. \u201cThat\u2019s about all I can take. Find me one of those.\u201d\nLindon rubbed the now-unclear point where his flesh became the Dreadgod\u2019s. \u201cI have spares, but you know that probably won\u2019t work.\u201d\nShe did. He\u2019d worn a weaker arm while advancing, worked his way up, and gotten his spirit used to the hunger. He also had an Icon that connected him to the authority of the arm, two compatible cores, an internal spiritual Enforcer technique, and probably fifty other things that made him uniquely attuned to the arm.\nBut this was frustrating. Without using his Enforcer techniques, he had matched one of her regular swings. She could probably overpower him if she had to, but that only lasted until he used the Burning Cloak.\nNot that a fight against him would rely on hand-to-hand power in the first place.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get there yourself!\u201d Lindon encouraged her. \u201cAlthough\u2026it would probably help if you spent more time with Red Faith\u2026\u201d\nShe felt her expression curdle like milk. \u201cIt was never a summertime dream of mine to work with him when he was alive. Not rosier about it now he\u2019s dead.\u201d\nThe Blood Sage\u2019s Remnant was working on a way to integrate the madra of the Bleeding Phoenix inside Yerin into a hunger technique on a level with Lindon\u2019s Consume. To do that, he needed her cooperation.\nShe\u2019d just rather do almost anything else.\nLindon gazed at her, quiet. Someone else would probably think he was trying to intimidate her, or maybe bore a hole through her with his eyes, but she could tell he was thinking hard about something.\nSure enough, he crept up to her, his voice low and gentle. \u201cI did bring something else for you. I was going to wait for the right time to give it to you, but since you\u2019re looking for an alternative\u2026Just forgive me if it\u2019s too surprising, all right?\u201d\nHearing him talk like that, she couldn\u2019t help but raise her expectations a little. And her heart rate sped up too, with him getting closer and talking all quiet about a gift.\nShe couldn\u2019t imagine what it would be, which was making her nervous. If it was something to improve her sacred arts, he wouldn\u2019t talk so soft about it.\nHe reached into his pocket\u2014not a void key\u2014and pulled out a small box wrapped in scripted bandages.\nWhen he began unwrapping it, she swallowed hard. \u201cHold a minute, wait\u2026what\u2026what is this, Lindon?\u201d\n\u201cSomething that should motivate you,\u201d he said, and she could see that he was excited about this. Nervous, too, which only ramped up her own nerves.\nThe bandages fell away, revealing a small box.\nYerin held up a hand. \u201cOi, wait, wait, wait. Not stone-certain I\u2019m as happy about surprises now as I was two minutes ago.\u201d\nLindon opened the box.\nInside was\u2026a pulsing, gray-white bulb of living madra that looked like a diseased organ.\nIt was surrounded by five or six other constructs of various colors, all smooth and metallic and forming a cage. Altogether, it resembled a failing heart being kept alive by a set of life-support constructs.\nThat\u2019s about what it felt like to her spiritual senses too.\nYerin wasn\u2019t sure what her expectations had been, but they came crashing down. She jabbed a finger at the mess in the box. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll activate it in just a minute. It\u2019s a binding I took from the labyrinth, though it was very difficult to get it to work outside. I suspect it won\u2019t last very long, but it should encourage you.\u201d\nHe was still talking around the point, but he obviously thought she\u2019d like it. She took a deep breath.", "300c3e6c-bec8-47f5-8106-c4b2dc122d4c": "Inside was\u2026a pulsing, gray-white bulb of living madra that looked like a diseased organ.\nIt was surrounded by five or six other constructs of various colors, all smooth and metallic and forming a cage.

She took a deep breath. \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll give it a peek, but you\u2019ve got to know that when you start talking soft about a gift, and how it\u2019s going to raise my spirits, I\u2019m not picturing a shiny new construct.\u201d\n\u201cWhat were you picturing?\u201d he asked curiously.\n\u2018Jewelry\u2019 was the answer, but that was so unsuited to Yerin that she couldn\u2019t make it come out of her mouth. She didn\u2019t even like jewelry, it was just\u2026the thing you were supposed to give at times like this. The thought behind it was more than just practicality.\nShe wanted something that was meant for her as a person, not her as a sacred artist. Something romantic.\nAlthough she had an even harder time saying the word \u201cromantic\u201d than she did the word \u201cjewelry,\u201d so she ignored the question and nodded to the construct.\n\u201cSo what\u2019s it do?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the Sword Sage\u2019s echo,\u201d he said.\nFor some reason, she hadn\u2019t expected him to answer so clearly. Her gaze snapped up from the construct to his face.\n\u201cTrue?\u201d\nHe gave her a sheepish smile. \u201cLike I said, I was going to ease you into it. Dross and I found him before we left, but I wanted a little more time to see if I could stabilize the binding further. He won\u2019t be as strong or as fully formed as he would be if we were back in the labyrinth, but it remembered him well. As he was when he explored it.\u201d\n\u201cAh. Uh. Huh.\u201d She took a deep breath. Her heart rate had picked up again. \u201cThanks for not popping him up on me with no warning.\u201d\n\u201cI remembered how you reacted to his void space. I didn\u2019t want you to stab me.\u201d\n\u201cLike you\u2019d be bothered by a little stab,\u201d Yerin said. She\u2019d meant it to come across as dry, but it sounded fond instead. She wrapped one arm around him but took the construct\u2019s box in the other hand.\nLindon leaned into her, but he was clearly itching to snatch the construct back. \u201cPardon, but I am the only one who can activate that. It\u2019s very delicate, and incompatible madra will disrupt the balance almost immediately.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t have any intention of activating it herself, so she squeezed him to acknowledge the words but didn\u2019t give it back. \u201cCan we give it a test swing right now?\u201d\n\u201cOf course!\u201d He hesitated, then leaned down to look into her face. \u201cDo you like it? I was worried you might be\u2026upset.\u201d\n\u201cNo, this is a winning blow from you. You\u2019ve got me.\u201d\nHe beamed, but her attention was still drawn back down to the construct.\nNow she was getting a chance to see her master\u2019s ghost. She had to be prepared. Netherclaw was sheathed at her hip; she wasn\u2019t sure she should draw it. Her master would recognize that it wasn\u2019t his.\nThis was too soon. Maybe she should wait, collect her thoughts some more.\n\u201cWaiting won\u2019t get me any sharper,\u201d Yerin muttered to herself.\nLindon held out the hunger binding in his right hand. It was surrounded by constructs keeping it stable, and his spiritual attention was on that, though his eyes were searching Yerin\u2019s face. \u201cAre you sure you want to do this now?\u201d\n\u201cSpent long enough bracing myself, haven\u2019t I?\u201d Yerin didn\u2019t really feel she was ready. She wished this was like a fight, which started whether you were ready or not. Now she had to decide when it started, which was like deciding her own execution.\nShe didn\u2019t want to draw it out any further, but she had to ask one more thing. \u201cWill he\u2026know me?\u201d\n\u201cThis is very advanced, but it\u2019s still a recording construct.", "4df5f5cc-1d22-48a7-8216-d0c8d087f0a5": "Her master would recognize that it wasn\u2019t his.\nThis was too soon.

I\u2019m projecting a pattern of his memories, with gaps filled in by the labyrinth. He\u2019ll remember you as you were, he might even recognize you, but he won\u2019t learn anything new or recall anything that happened from a previous projection. We\u2019ve only seen one exception to that.\u201d\nShe looked at him in curiosity before she figured out the question on her own. \u201cEithan,\u201d she said.\n\u201cEithan. I don\u2019t know if his echo is better at tapping into the labyrinth\u2019s other memories or if he\u2019s only pretending to learn things.\u201d\n\u201cPut my bet on \u2018both.\u2019 Anyway, good news for me that this is just a recording. If you could bring back the dead, you\u2019d twist my brain in knots.\u201d She drew herself up. \u201cThat\u2019s enough dragging from me. Start it up.\u201d\n\u201cHere we go, then. Three, two\u2026one.\u201d\nEven after the countdown, he fed his madra into the binding gently. Pure madra swirled up through his spirit and filtered through his Dreadgod arm, bearing a hint of hunger. Must have been harder than activating it with pure madra alone; hunger only wanted to take.\n\u201cCome forth,\u201d Lindon commanded.\nThe empty air trembled as his working took hold, and misty gray-white light swirled into the figure of a man, tracing him from the feet upward.\nHe wore ragged robes like her own. They would be black, though projected as these were from hunger madra, they merely looked like a darker shade of gray. A sword hung from his left hip. He wasn\u2019t tall and imposing, and his shoulders weren\u2019t terribly broad\u2014he had shorter limbs than most people would say was ideal for a swordsman, and he was wiry instead of muscular.\nThen his face formed, and Yerin had to manually slow her breathing.\nHe had sleepy eyes and unkempt hair, though he stayed clean-shaven. He constantly wore the slight, wry smile of a man who saw something sarcastically funny in the world.\nHe looked her up and down, and Yerin\u2019s spirit froze in fear. This was the moment she had most dreaded, the one that had made her drag her feet in summoning him. Would he recognize her? It had been a long time, after all. What if he did recognize her, but disapproved?\n\u201cBleed me, but you\u2019ve cleaned up,\u201d her master said. \u201cHerald. Never thought I\u2019d see the day.\u201d His crooked smile widened a little. \u201cGuess I never did, did I?\u201d\nYerin\u2019s eyes misted up, and she laughed while she swiped at them. \u201cYeah, you skipped out on me early.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like me.\u201d He tapped his forehead. \u201cI like the hair. Made the Blood Shadow part of you. Did I figure that out?\u201d\nShe shook her head. Then she told him the story.\nHer sense of the construct suggested this would only last for a few minutes, so she had to skim along the surface. Especially because Lindon was doing his best to pretend he wasn\u2019t in the room, though she introduced him anyway.\nWhen Yerin finished telling her master about Ruby and achieving a Herald state early, the Sword Sage twisted to scan Lindon.\nLindon took the observation calmly. That came as a mild surprise; she had expected he would shift and squirm under the Sword Sage\u2019s gaze, like he had when introducing her to his family.\nHer master rested a hand on his sword and jerked his head to Lindon. \u201cSo you trust him?\u201d\nYerin nodded.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a razor-edged risk.

Likely to lose those fingers if you keep poking into my business.\u201d\nThe hunger echo held up his hands in surrender. \u201cDon\u2019t chew me to pieces, I was just stepping careful.\u201d\n\u201cNot me,\u201d Yerin said, before starting the second part of the conversation that she was nervous about. \u201cWe\u2019re looking to get the Dreadgods out of Cradle.\u201d\nThe Sword Sage\u2019s head jerked back. He looked to Lindon, then back to Yerin. Then he barked a laugh. \u201cKnew when I headed to the maze that I was tickling Monarchs in their secrets. Passed that down to you, did I?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the help I need from you. You have something for me that can cut Monarchs and Dreadgods?\u201d\nThe Sage rubbed a finger in his ear as though to clean it out. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about hitting above my advancement level, all nice and casual. But yeah, I\u2019ve got something for you.\u201d\nYerin\u2019s expectations rose.\n\u201cSword Icon. You\u2019re a Herald, so the Icon will be quiet as a whisper. Doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s gone anywhere.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a short road,\u201d Yerin said. \u201cWon\u2019t have long to practice once I\u2019m a Monarch. If I outstay my welcome, that just chases the problem round and round.\u201d\nThe Sword Sage shrugged. \u201cDon\u2019t outstay your welcome, then. But I didn\u2019t mean a road as long as Monarch anyway. It\u2019s like I said: Sword Icon hasn\u2019t gone anywhere. Heralds can resonate with it as well as anyone, they\u2019re just deaf to it.\u201d\nLindon nodded to him. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of the theory, but I thought she needed to find a different Icon. She\u2019s not on a pure sword Path anymore.\u201d\n\u201cThen what kind of Sage does that make you?\u201d the Sword Sage scoffed. \u201cGive it another century before you come to me with your opinions.\u201d\nLindon looked like he was about ready to prove himself with some black dragon\u2019s breath, judging by the way his right arm was twitching.\nDidn\u2019t bother Yerin, though, because she saw through her master. She grinned and spoke to Lindon. \u201cDon\u2019t let him shake you up. He\u2019s needled because you\u2019re my age but you could break him in half with both hands behind your back.\u201d\n\u201cGrew a mouth on you, didn\u2019t you?\u201d her master grumbled.\nShe pointed to Lindon. \u201cOi, did the labyrinth show you how he killed the Silent King?\u201d\n\u201cEmriss could have\u2014\u201d The Sword Sage visibly realized he\u2019d been about to compare Lindon to a Monarch and forced a cough. \u201cLet\u2019s not get off the trail here.\u201d\nLindon looked like he\u2019d had a breath of fresh air.\n\u201cLike I was saying,\u201d the Sage continued, \u201cpeople think of Sage as opening yourself up and Herald as closing yourself off.

Just copy them.\u201d\nLindon\u2019s quill was scribbling furiously, but he was still frowning into midair with an expression like he was deep in thought.\nYerin thought she understood what her master was saying, but it didn\u2019t seem practical. \u201cSo I\u2019ve got to watch a Monarch using a sword?\u201d\n\u201cOr a Sage. Min Shuei will teach you.\u201d He hesitated. \u201cIs she\u2026solid? She\u2019s still got her sect, true?\u201d\nYerin tapped her fingers against her sheath for a moment. \u201cCaught sight of her once or twice. Not sure she\u2019s so happy with you for dying.\u201d\n\u201cWasn\u2019t the plan, that I can swear. Not in love with how we left things, though. You always think you have more time, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nThat wouldn\u2019t have stabbed Yerin so deep, but she was planning on facing down both Dreadgods and Monarchs. By most reckoning, even a dozen lives wouldn\u2019t be enough.\nInvoluntarily, she looked to Lindon.\nHe was perfectly calm. Still taking notes. He\u2019d heard, she was sure, he just wasn\u2019t thinking about the risks. He had a mission.\nThe side of her mouth quirked up. \u201cShort on time myself, so what can you teach me?\u201d\nThe Sword Sage looked down at himself in disgust. \u201cWhat am I going to show you in this state? Maybe if I was plugged into the labyrinth, I could imitate some of my real authority, but like this\u2026I have the power of my shortest toe. You\u2019re a Herald; you have to have seen some decent fights.\u201d\nYerin cast her mind back. The battle between the Sage of Red Faith and the Herald Redmoon popped into her memory first. The Sage had used a series of daggers. She\u2019d seen Monarchs in battle too, but Malice usually carried a bow while Northstrider didn\u2019t seem to need a weapon at all.\n\u201cDoes it have to be a sword?\u201d Lindon asked quietly.\n\u201cBest if it is,\u201d the Sword Sage said. He patted the weapon at his side. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why the cutting Icon takes the form of a sword. It\u2019s the perfect tool for combat. But no, of course you can use sword authority through just about any cutting weapon.\u201d\nYerin realized what Lindon was implying, and a jolt shook her body. \u201cBlood and rot, there\u2019s reaching for the moon and then there\u2019s jumping off a roof to touch the stars.

The sight of Eithan drifting in the dark sky was etched into her memory, though there were parts she was blind to. Things they did that her mind just couldn\u2019t process. And what she did see was missing miles of depth, she was sure.\nAs the Eithan in her memory drew back his scythe, she drew back her sword.\n\u201cYou\u2019re copying what you can\u2019t see,\u201d her master advised her. \u201cFocus on the feeling of the strike more than its form.\u201d\nHis strike had felt final.

Like the end of all things.\nIn her memory, Eithan swept his weapon forward.\nShe followed him.\nHis strike was silent, and so was hers.\nYerin opened her eyes.\nNothing in the room had changed. She\u2019d failed.\nThe Sword Sage folded his arms. \u201cOne practice swing down. Nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine to go.\u201d\nNow that was the master she remembered.", "810e8ddf-c222-443c-b6fe-459eb2a63805": "8\n\n\n\n\n\nReigan Shen returned to a spatial anchor just outside of Moongrave.\nThe dark clouds overhead flickered with violet lightning, reminding him of the Weeping Dragon\u2019s clouds that approached the Ashwind continent. But these weren\u2019t the signs of a coming Dreadgod, just those of a furious Monarch.\nEven with their current state of temporary alliance, Shen knew better than to appear in the city itself. He hovered outside the gates and spoke clearly.\n\u201cNot even I can travel like this forever, Malice. You know the time has come.\u201d\nMalice must have been upset, because she didn\u2019t taunt him or make him wait or strike him with an arrow from miles away. Instead, she appeared next to him immediately.\nHer hair, like living shadow, writhed with her anger. She appeared as immaculate and unharmed as ever, but her fight against Eithan\u2019s apprentices must have taken something out of her or she wouldn\u2019t have shown such a sour expression.\n\u201cHow did you enjoy his Dreadgod weapon?\u201d Malice asked bitterly. \u201cHe\u2019ll be adding another to his collection soon, thanks to you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re helpless to watch?\u201d Reigan snapped back. \u201cThese are your lands! Clean up your mess.\u201d\nHe wanted to transform back into his original form and bite her head off. Malice was only pestering him to express her anger, but Reigan had just as much right to be furious as she did. He had told them how seriously they needed to take this threat. He had told them.\nMalice ground her teeth, and Reigan could see her resisting the urge to continue bickering with him. Argument was one of the petty pleasures humans loved to squeeze out of life.\nInstead, she steadied herself to face the problem at hand, as befit a Monarch. \u201cOf course I won\u2019t allow him to do as he wishes. My forces were already gathered to deal with a Dreadgod. Once the Weeping Dragon wears them down, we can finish them off.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m certain they have a pocket world,\u201d Reigan told her. \u201cWe have to assume they have enough time built up inside to emerge as Monarchs. I will not underestimate the influence of Eithan Arelius.\u201d\n\u201cNot again, you mean.\u201d She poked back at him, but her lack of reaction to the pocket world told him she had already known and was thinking along the same lines.\nReigan didn\u2019t let her distract him. \u201cThe longer we give them, the better prepared they will be. We can\u2019t wait for the Dreadgod before we strike.\u201d\n\u201cStrike where, would you say?\u201d\n\u201cSacred Valley. He\u2019s proven he will defend it.\u201d\nMalice raised an eyebrow. \u201cYou propose we strike at the Master of the Labyrinth above the labyrinth\u2019s heart, all with the Weeping Dragon bearing down on us?\u201d\n\u201cUnless you know where he\u2019s placed the entrance to his world, we only know one other place where he will certainly appear. And that\u2019s directly in the path of the Dreadgod.\u201d Reigan folded his arms. \u201cSo yes, I would prefer Sacred Valley.\u201d\nLike a flickering shadow, Malice shifted her position in an instant. \u201cGood. That\u2019s what I planned. Northstrider?\u201d\nNorthstrider emerged from a bright blue twist in the Way, surprising no one. Reigan had sensed his observation from the beginning.\nThe man wore his rags, as usual, and his draconic eyes shone with golden intensity.\n\u201cLindon Arelius is their lynchpin,\u201d Northstrider said immediately. \u201cIf we kill, capture, or force him to ascend, the others must follow. Our best chance of doing any of the three is to drive him away from the labyrinth. The approaching Dreadgod will set the hourglass for him, as he still cannot face the Weeping Dragon alone.\u201d\nIt was only out of a disciplined desire for cooperation that Reigan Shen did not roll his eyes. \u201cWhat an apt summary. Are you ready to begin?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m ready to end it,\u201d Malice snapped. \u201cThis has been a disaster from start to finish.\u201d\nReigan would certainly be embarrassed if he were Malice. It was not too exaggerated to say the state of the world was entirely her fault. Ozmanthus had risen to prominence under her nose, and she hadn\u2019t noticed\u2026although perhaps that wasn\u2019t a technique Reigan should lean on to attack her, since the same could be said of him.\nRegardless, Reigan Shen would not be able to rest again until he no longer shared a world with these miniature Destroyers.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Northstrider said.\nMalice looked down over the members of her clan, who had begun arranging themselves below. \u201cSoon.

Golds were useless here, and even most Lords were dead weight, but she still had a squad of several dozen ready to go soon. He was reassured to see that she had brought two Sages along as well, though he did wish they were two other Sages.\nThey could potentially rely on Charity, whose smooth face was as expressionless as usual, but her purple eyes tracked Reigan Shen with barely concealed hostility. Her passion for humanity was legendary, and she resented all factions that were primarily led by sacred beasts. He didn\u2019t think she would ever turn against the will of her grandmother, but he would have to account for the possibility that she gave in to temptation and attacked his people.\nThen there was the Sage of the Frozen Blade, Min Shuei. The woman fiddled with her long, white hair, drummed fingers on the edge of her sheathed sword, and chewed on her lip as a storm of emotions passed through her.\nReigan knew why. She had been romantically involved with Yerin\u2019s master, and she considered the girl something of a daughter.\nHe indicated her with his chin. \u201cIs she not a liability?\u201d\n\u201cSee how many loyal Sages you have left when the Dreadgods attack your territory over and over,\u201d Malice said. \u201cI, for one, consider it an advantage to have the Winter Sage on our side. If she can convince Yerin to see reason and ascend, perhaps the others will follow.\u201d\nYerin wouldn\u2019t do that, and it could be that everyone there knew it except Min Shuei. Her expression brightened for a moment.\nReigan did roll his eyes this time, but he accepted the woman\u2019s presence. Her power was a welcome asset, even if her disposition wasn\u2019t. And once Yerin refused to ascend, Min Shuei would beat the necessity into her.\nThe Winter Sage, after all, had known the truth behind the Monarchs. She knew how to accept the world as it was.\nOnce everyone was ready, Reigan could have offered to transport them all together. That was usually his role, as the master of the King\u2019s Key, but he had spent a dozen fortunes moving armies across the world recently. Time to let their host bear the cost.\nHe calmly sipped wine and watched Malice. She scowled at him but triggered a portal anchor instead of complaining. A tower of shadow shot up from the ground; clearly, she had been prepared for this.\n\u201cEveryone move,\u201d Malice ordered.\nThe other Monarchs were already striding through the portal.\nReigan felt the familiar twisting of the Way all around him, though it was shrouded by shadows. It would take time for Lindon to sense the pillar of shadow using the constructs around the Valley, so they should be able to get into position before he realized they were coming.\nReigan Shen\u2019s perception, like everyone else\u2019s, was restricted by the combination of overwhelming shadow madra and spatial transport.\nBut the reaction times of a Monarch were nothing to underestimate, so he was able to call his Titan shield out of nowhere the instant he emerged from the portal.\nA Penance arrow slammed into the Abidan panel of blue light, and Reigan felt his own death stop an inch from his nose.\nCopied arrows swarmed the others. Malice covered herself in armor\u2014not swollen to giant size, now, but called around her normal human body in an instant. Northstrider burned the illusions down with an aura of blood and hunger and struck them from the air with blurring punches.\nBut both staggered back as illusions ravaged their minds.

Even the copies carried formidable mental weight. Without a defensive construct as advanced as Reigan\u2019s, they were still vulnerable.\nOrdinarily, Reigan would have felt smug at their struggle and perhaps worked to find a way to humiliate them over it. But he was faced with a sight that chilled him.\nDozens of miles away, Lindon hovered over Sacred Valley. The air warped around him and a halo of light ringed the sky overhead.\nHe had been waiting for them. And the Silent King Bow was not his only weapon.\nThree streams of black dragon\u2019s breath crashed into the Monarchs a fraction of a second after the arrows, but this they could take easily. He was more than a Sage now, but still less than a true Dreadgod.\nNorthstrider held out a palm, Shen summoned a shield, and Malice trusted her armor to handle it as she called her own bow.\nWhen the bar of liquid flame struck, Reigan Shen learned how wrong he had been.\nThe Void authority in the dragon\u2019s breath was on another level, even compared to when he\u2019d fought Reigan that morning. Even considering the benefits of a time-warped pocket world, Lindon was progressing at a disgusting rate.\nClearly, the human had trained himself, not just his companions.\nBlack dragon\u2019s breath annihilated a Herald-level shield, crushed a script written specifically to hold back the Path of Black Flame, and triggered Reigan\u2019s Titan barrier again.\nThat was two activations within a second. This time, Reigan felt the power in the Abidan artifact flickering.\nAmethyst essence streamed off Malice as the river of dark fire stripped away layers of her armor, and Northstrider grunted as his hand was burned down to the bone. It would regenerate in an instant, but even so, they had underestimated Lindon.\nIt wouldn\u2019t happen again.\nThe Penance arrow had vanished, but there was already another volley in the air, this one made of the simple bone arrows that were a tier weaker. As Reigan had suspected, he didn\u2019t have more Penance arrowheads. Likely only the two he\u2019d shown.\nAnd while it was wise of Lindon to keep the pressure on, Monarchs didn\u2019t earn their way to the top by being slow to react.\nA matching volley of arrows shot from Malice\u2019s crystalline blue bow, and hers were Forged from a more solid madra and backed by the Bow Icon. Her arrows hunted down and destroyed his, though it wasn\u2019t as one-sided a match as Reigan had hoped.\nIn the back of his mind, he felt an ugly greed for that Dreadgod weapon. No matter how else this all shook out, he needed to end up with the Silent King Bow.\nThough Reigan wasn\u2019t idle while Malice struck back. He transferred himself through space and withdrew a fine weapon of his own: a trio of blue-and-green metal claws that he gripped in his human hands. He slashed out with them, and Forged claws struck from the sky to catch Lindon between them.\nAt the same time, Northstrider punched with a deafening explosion of air that shook the earth like a drum. The accompanying Striker technique hurtled at Lindon, a white-edged crimson serpent of blood madra that carried the authority of an ancient dragon.\nFrom stepping through the portal to now took less time than the blink of an Underlord\u2019s eye, and such battles could rage on for days. Except they didn\u2019t necessarily have days.\nWhile the Weeping Dragon was thousands of miles north, the empowered Dreadgods could move faster than ever. If it chose, the Dragon could be here in a matter of hours.\nReigan Shen fully expected Lindon to have countermeasures in the labyrinth for this round of attacks.

Drain his resources dry.\nAnd, most importantly, keep him out of that pocket world.\nLindon\u2019s pure madra domain erupted from him in a blue-white sphere, weakening the incoming techniques, but Lindon still had to tear Northstrider\u2019s dragon and Reigan\u2019s claws apart physically.\nThat was when Reigan Shen knew something was wrong.\nHe understood the labyrinth better than anyone alive. Grudgingly, he had to admit that Lindon probably knew some tricks with it he didn\u2019t, as Reigan had never successfully claimed authority over it. But he was confident he knew its mechanisms better even than the young Sage.\nYet Lindon did know how to activate its defensive scripts. He had done so against Reigan Shen only hours ago.\nWhy hadn\u2019t he done that now? Why was he taking Monarch attacks with his own body?\nThe world crawled to a halt as Reigan\u2019s thoughts flashed. Had the labyrinth run out of power? No, he could distantly sense the mighty cores that powered the great scripts still thrumming with energy. Then was this a trick?\nIt had to be. Something was wrong here.\nNorthstrider had come to the same conclusion even faster, as he Forged a defensive layer of bloody madra around himself. Malice had strung another arrow and surely intended to trust her armor once again.\nAnother volley of arrows erupted from Sacred Valley\u2026but not from Lindon.\nThey were a dim grey and comprised mostly of hunger madra, but Shen still recognized them. This was Malice\u2019s technique.\nA gray-white Forged dragon roared as it rushed at Northstrider, but it was when portals began to open in midair and reveal copied weapons that Reigan Shen realized he was in trouble.\nThe labyrinth stored copies of everyone it fed from.\nHe\u2019d known that, but there was one ironclad restriction on that technique: it could only be used inside the labyrinth itself.\nExcept that rule no longer held true. The evidence was right in front of him.\nAll three of the Monarchs defended against their own techniques easily\u2014these were from the weakened versions of themselves, after all. The true threat was the Penance arrow that thundered through space and Fate at Reigan Shen.\nHe trusted his Titan shield and opened up with a barrage of weapons. Until Northstrider shouted, \u201cMalice!\u201d Both of the other Monarchs focused their wills on Reigan.\nTo\u2026protect him.\nA second Penance arrow fell from the sky like black lightning. He felt his death resonating from the future, as though the universe itself had decided to kill him. The other Monarchs were underestimating him, though. The Abidan artifact was not so simple, and another Titan shield appeared above him.\nWhen the third Penance arrow struck at him from behind, that was when Reigan realized he was going to die.\nEvery shield, barrier, script, and scrap of armor he could summon leaped out of his many vaults and onto his body.\nThe blue plates of absolute Abidan protection shivered under the weight of triple execution\u2026and then they cracked. The metal strapped to his wrist, the platinum Titan artifact, tore in half like cloth.\n\u201cProtect!\u201d Northstrider commanded.\n\u201cStop!\u201d Malice ordered.\n\u201cSave me!\u201d Reigan Shen cried.\nWhen the arrows passed through the Abidan defenses, the other layers were obliterated in an instant. One arrow lost momentum, but the second rushed at him like a river of pure destruction. Malice threw an arm in front of it and her armor was annihilated to reveal her bare arm, but that arrow ran out of strength as well.\nShen was looking up in terror at the black arrowhead plunging down from overhead, flinching back behind crossed arms\u2026but it too froze a hair from his skin.\nNorthstrider had caught it.\nThe human Monarch coughed up blood and tried to crush the arrow in his fist. \u201cThis\u2026weapon\u2026\u201d\nEven with the authority of the Strength Icon, Northstrider couldn\u2019t break it.", "f37f2cc9-b97a-416b-8845-107afdec1298": "The metal strapped to his wrist, the platinum Titan artifact, tore in half like cloth.\n\u201cProtect!\u201d Northstrider commanded.\n\u201cStop!\u201d Malice ordered.\n\u201cSave me!\u201d Reigan Shen cried.\nWhen the arrows passed through the Abidan defenses, the other layers were obliterated in an instant.

Literally, as illusory cloned arrows blacked out the sun.\nReigan Shen knew the other Monarchs acted solely for their own protection. If they thought they could win without Reigan\u2019s help, they would have watched him die with glee in their hearts. On another day, they would have helped Lindon.\nBut relying on their assistance still burned his pride, so now it was his turn.\nReigan Shen released his madra, and a golden light surrounded the three Monarchs for a mile in all directions. \u201cMine,\u201d he said, as he joined his authority to the King\u2019s Domain.\nThe copied arrows crashed down on his Domain. They tore parts of it away, drilled down into the golden light, and even tickled his mind with distant mental attacks. But every arrow was shunted to the side, landing nowhere near the Monarchs.\nOr the collection of Sages and Archlords that had emerged from the pillar of shadow beneath them.\n\u201cDo that sooner,\u201d Northstrider said coldly.\nReigan\u2019s head was splitting with the effort of using such high-level commands so soon after one another, not to mention the strain of maintaining powerful weapons, but he kept control of himself and snorted. \u201cAs though you\u2019ve used everything you\u2019re capable of.\u201d\nMalice had re-formed the amethyst plating around her arm. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the boy hasn\u2019t either.\u201d\nLindon must have been far more exhausted than Reigan himself, but he didn\u2019t look it, and the bow in his hand warped Reigan\u2019s spiritual perception.\nHe was only a Sage.\nThe Silent King\u2019s halo over his head had grown, and it was starting to fill in with a subtly spinning darkness. The Void Icon. It matched his eyes: harsh white circles in pools of merciless black.\nTwo figures had joined Lindon, and they were eerily familiar. Echoes in gray-white of a young woman with a bow and a scruffy young man with scales covering his fists. Younger Malice and Northstrider.\nThe real Malice ran a hand down her bow, considering. \u201cIs he paying the price to maintain them, or is it the labyrinth?\u201d\n\u201cIt has to be the labyrinth,\u201d Northstrider said. \u201cIf he was doing it himself, he could have kept the defensive scripts up.\u201d\nMalice gave an irritated hiss. \u201cThen we can\u2019t fight him here.\u201d\nReigan Shen looked into the sky, fury boiling up from his heart. \u201cEnough. Scorch the earth.\u201d\nHe willed himself to move as high as he could, reappearing an instant later. The world stretched out beneath him even as the breath left his lungs. He hung now in the stillness of the stars, above the sky, until Sacred Valley itself was but a smudge far below.\nReigan opened two portals to his left and right, forming a third technique between his hands.\nEach of the gates he opened revealed one of his singular vaults, where he kept the most unique and deadly treasures. One was a room of cold, bare gray, where scripted halfsilver chains restrained a spear.\nFashioned from the soul of a Monarch and the rarest of materials, the spear looked to be made of weathered sandstone, but its every sharp edge shone like molten steel.\nBlighted Sky, a weapon created by two Sages of Steel Dragon\u2019s Mountain to do battle with ancient Monarchs. Over time, its legend and power had only grown, and it was responsible for the creation of a desert on the Iceflower continent.\nOne of his rarest treasures.\nThe other vault contained another one-of-a-kind Monarch weapon, and one that Reigan was more personally attached to.

His collar flashed as he looked up at the opening portal.\n\u201cYou want me to kill some more of my family members, Shen?\u201d Tiberian asked. Air was rushing out of the vault in a sparkling rush, a cold breeze as the wind vented into vacuum, but Reigan responded in a transmission of dream aura.\nYes, he said. An adopted one. There.\nHe indicated the location with a thought.\nTiberian grimaced, but he raised a hand that crackled with power.\nDon\u2019t hold back, Reigan added.\nThe Remnant lowered its hand and considered for a moment. Then three colored balls of lightning crackled around his body, growing more powerful with every passing instant. One was blue, one gold, and one a molten, green-tinged white.\nTiberian\u2019s greatest technique, his True Storm Hammer. It would be enough to annihilate Sacred Valley and anyone standing against it, unless Lindon spent his whole power defending or activated the great defensive script.\nBut Reigan didn\u2019t watch Tiberian finish the technique. He began his own most powerful art.\nOpening portals onto spatially sealed treasures was not the only use of the Path of the King\u2019s Key, like so many thought. It was simply the most efficient one.\nMost threats, he could handle with his vast collection of weaponry. For some purposes, he controlled the battlefield with his King\u2019s Domain.\nFor those last, stubborn targets, Reigan needed to get his own hands dirty. No target could perfectly defend against this technique. Not even Tiberian himself.\nWith his madra and his authority, Reigan gripped the fabric of space. He tore and crumpled it until it resembled a golden-edged shattered ball.\nThis was any king\u2019s last resort: the Decree of Execution.\nAny one of these three techniques should be plenty to destroy not only Lindon, but a significant chunk of the surrounding territory. Malice would be displeased with him, but she knew what he was doing. It would be upon her to contain the destruction.\nIf she even could. With these three techniques layered together, they would produce an effect that was\u2014\nTiberian released his True Storm Hammer.\n\u201cNot yet!\u201d Reigan tried to shout, but the air was gone. He roared in silence.\nAs a mountain-thick pillar of lightning cracked down to earth, the storm Remnant looked up to Reigan in evident surprise. He tapped one ear and shrugged.\nReigan snarled, though Tiberian wouldn\u2019t hear that either, and released his Decree of Execution. It flashed down, almost as fast as the lightning, leaving trails of splintered space behind it as it fell.\nOnly then could he trigger the Striker binding inside the spear, Blighted Sky. A wide spread of smoldering orange spikes rained down, each hungry to spread destruction.\nThe three techniques weren\u2019t synced up as well as Reigan had hoped, but he was still satisfied with the initial result. A giant column of three-colored lightning, chased afterward by a gold-highlighted warp in space, and followed by a broad waterfall of burning light.\nReigan tucked himself away into one of his mobile palaces, enjoying the taste of air contained within.

AAAAAAHHHH it\u2019s so bad!]\nLindon\u2019s perception of the world was effectively halted, though that wasn\u2019t much of a comfort when a massive Monarch thunderbolt was a few hundred yards from crashing down on him. He should survive that, with the help of his arm and his Hollow Domain. The arm, at least, was eager to try.\nBut there was another technique behind that, one that would disassemble the very substance of his body. And if he resisted that, there was a broad technique that felt\u2014in Dross\u2019 words\u2014like a plague made of wildfire.\nThe other two Monarchs hadn\u2019t even joined the attack. They had used techniques to surround Sacred Valley, to contain the destruction and to slow Lindon from leaving.\nNot that he could. Shen\u2019s techniques landing would threaten the lives of the people living down below.\nHe hadn\u2019t wanted to fight here at all, but the labyrinth\u2019s defenses were all that allowed him to survive three Monarchs at once. But even those defenses had limits. He\u2019d ordered the population below to take shelter and activated protections against spiritual pressure, but he was putting the ancient scripts to the test.\nDon\u2019t panic, Lindon sent to Dross. You know what we have to do.\n[It\u2019s too late, I\u2019m panicking! They were supposed to back off!]\nDross and Lindon had both expected the Monarchs to back up and stall for time once their initial attack failed. They would be waiting for the Weeping Dragon to finish Lindon, after all. That assumption was what Lindon had been counting on; his only objective was to buy enough time for his friends to advance.\nIt was always a possibility that one of the Monarchs would get frustrated and unload everything they had, but not one that Lindon or Dross could control.\n[The echo isn\u2019t finished!] Dross said desperately. [We have to use the evacuation plan.]\nThe \u2018evacuation plan\u2019 was using the labyrinth to transfer everyone away and letting Reigan Shen blow Sacred Valley to ashes. The labyrinth would survive, and they could rebuild afterwards.\nThat would be a huge expenditure of energy, and those attacks landing could blight the earth for hundreds of miles. Not to mention that the Weeping Dragon was still heading this direction, and Lindon wanted the labyrinth in fighting shape. He intended to fight the Dreadgod over the Trackless Sea, but this was his fallback.\nAlso, the Monarchs had more for Lindon to take.\nNo, he thought. I\u2019ll hold the lightning back. Release him.\n[Do you know how much I hate relying on things we don\u2019t understand and can\u2019t model? This much!] Dross\u2019 arms stretched impossibly far so that Lindon couldn\u2019t see their ends.\nApologies, Lindon said, and then the world started moving again.\nTiberian\u2019s thunderbolt was large enough to swallow the heart of Sacred Valley, but it fell through a suddenly expanded Hollow Domain and met Lindon\u2019s white palm. Lightning shot through his body, bringing him agony. His teeth grit together and he struggled to remain focused.\nLindon drew the energy deeper with his Consume technique, pulling the lightning to himself. His whole spirit was in anguish, but at the same time, he wove his own madra through Tiberian\u2019s technique. Strands of pure madra, of hunger, even Blackflame.\nThey wormed into the lightning bolt according to a method he\u2019d adopted from Ozmanthus Arelius. Not enough to be called a true sacred arts technique, this was more of a skilled manipulation of madra. It took longer than he would have liked, with the Monarch lightning tearing apart his body.\nBut an instant later, he dismantled the technique.\nThe different types of power tore apart Tiberian\u2019s thunderbolt, sending clouds of three-colored essence bursting for miles. They exploded against the barriers set up by Northstrider and Malice, lighting the sky so that even the halo of the Silent King dimmed by comparison.\nLindon was breathing heavily when the next technique came streaking in, and his vision fuzzed on the edges.", "09518ee4-a723-4840-93b5-d3ed8ec4cb05": "His whole spirit was in anguish, but at the same time, he wove his own madra through Tiberian\u2019s technique.

He had been sprinting all-out with these techniques, and while he still had madra to spare, he needed to rest. Every Penance arrow was a test of will, and he was concentrating to his limits with every attack. Even holding the Silent King Bow was an extra burden.\nHe released the Hollow Domain, allowing himself to catch his breath as the gold-edged chaos descended on him. He needed to buy a little time, since the echo technique from the labyrinth was not instant.\nBut it was quick.\n\u201cSloppy,\u201d said a cold voice from nearby. It was familiar and unfamiliar at the same time, like a slightly distorted imitation of a voice he knew well.\nA black-and-gray Ozmanthus Arelius stood next to Lindon, broom braced on his shoulder.\nHis features were sharp and his demeanor haughty, but his clothes were still finely pressed. He sneered up at the descending technique. \u201cDismantling should be clean. Like so.\u201d\nOzmanthus swept his broom through the sky, and the space-ripping golden sphere disappeared. So did the rain of orange-red blades, and the Silent King\u2019s halo, and the indistinct Void Icon that had hovered over Lindon.\nLindon gazed up into a perfectly clear sky.\nOzmanthus gave a satisfied little hum. \u201cYou see? Clean.\u201d\n\u201cGratitude,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cBut the enemy who used those techniques is still there. In fact, there are three Monarchs, and they\u2019re enemies of your\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI understand the situation,\u201d Ozmanthus said, cutting him off. \u201cI saw every detail the instant I was Forged. You should assume that I see everything.\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d\nThe barriers around Sacred Valley were starting to fade as Northstrider and Malice gathered up their own attacks, but Ozmanthus was still focused on Lindon. A small smile quirked up the corner of his mouth, and Lindon saw shadows of the Eithan he knew.\n\u201cSuch a high opinion of me,\u201d Ozmanthus murmured. \u201cI\u2019ll try not to let it go to my head.\u201d\nLindon heard the wry tone and inspected the man\u2019s expression for more traces of Eithan. Should he speak freely, or not?\n[Not!] Dross suggested.\nLindon dipped his head. \u201cApologies. I\u2019m grateful for the help.\u201d He held the Arelius Patriarch\u2019s gaze firmly. \u201cBut I prefer the modern version of you.\u201d\nOzmanthus looked startled for a moment before his smile grew more genuine. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to hear it. Now\u2026\u201d He looked at the sky. \u201c\u2026if you wanted me to wipe out our enemies, why did you make me so weak?\u201d\n\u201cLack of time.\u201d\n\u201cPoor planning. You should improve your foresight. No student of mine should ever be caught off guard.\u201d\n[We\u2019re working on it,] Dross said defensively.\nLindon tensed and cycled his madra. Malice had called the image of an empress behind her and was readying an attack no less deadly than the ones Reigan Shen had dropped, and Northstrider condensed so much power that half the horizon turned red and a snarling dragon\u2019s face was starting to form from blood and authority.\n\u201cI can strike once, with the power you have allotted me,\u201d Ozmanthus said. \u201cAfterwards, you will not be able to project me again for quite some time without destabilizing my memory.\u201d\nLindon turned to face Malice, as her attack seemed most imminent. \u201cWhich target would you prefer?\u201d\nOzmanthus barked a laugh. \u201cI thought you knew me well.

An arrow layered with many techniques and condensed power. From the other side of the valley, a serpentine dragon was Forged from Northstrider\u2019s madra. It thundered through the sky to them, and the weight of its charge reminded Lindon of a physical blow from a Dreadgod.\nIn a delicate dance, Ozmanthus spun the cloak that surrounded him.\nThe Mantle of the Hollow King caught Malice\u2019s arrow as though in the flow of a river, dragging it miles away from its course and flinging it back at Northstrider. At the same time, the Hollow King\u2019s Spear pierced the dragon, blasting into the horizon as a Striker technique. Its destruction tore a ditch in the landscape in a straight line that stretched as far as Lindon could see.\nNorthstrider dodged the spear, but not Malice\u2019s arrow, which had been subtly redirected according to Ozmanthus\u2019 will.\n\u201cOne,\u201d Ozmanthus murmured, \u201ctwo. And\u2026three.\u201d\nLines of light fell down from the stars overhead. The Hollow King\u2019s Crown dissipated harmlessly long before it ever struck the ground, but the technique intercepted something on its way.\nLindon sensed Reigan Shen\u2019s vaults being torn apart, far above. Even the separate space in which he\u2019d hidden was shattered, and his spiritual presence weakened considerably.\nLindon was sure his eyes were wide. \u201cIncredible.\u201d Though different in many ways, this was still Eithan, and stroking his ego couldn\u2019t hurt. But it wasn\u2019t as though he needed to fake his amazement.\nOzmanthus had already started to fade, but he tilted his chin up. \u201cHardly worth mentioning. Summon me properly next time, and I\u2019ll show you something you can really be proud of.\u201d His eyes flicked to the top of Lindon\u2019s head for a moment. \u201c\u2026and get a haircut.\u201d", "24151606-8cbd-41da-a483-737b14e05ac4": "9\n\n\n\n\n\nOrthos and Little Blue fought together against a single opponent.\nThey stood in an ocean of darkness, where it was impossible to tell apart the ground from the horizon. Little Blue defended them both, deflecting madra attacks and disrupting the spiritual power of the enemy, while Orthos stayed on the offensive. Lances of dragon\u2019s breath shot from his mouth while he dashed, jumped, and slammed his shell into the enemy.\nThe blonde, smiling, well-dressed enemy.\nEithan slid between them as easily as if it were a dance they\u2019d all rehearsed. He twirled a spoon in each hand, using one to slash open Little Blue\u2019s Hollow Domain even as he used the other to nudge Orthos\u2019 charge off-course.\nThey had been at this for almost an hour, and Orthos was rapidly losing patience.\nFinally, after Orthos put his all into a Void Dragon\u2019s Dance that Eithan scooped away with a casual sweep of his spoon, Orthos called the fight to a halt. \u201cDross! Enough!\u201d\nThe darkness evaporated, as did their still-smiling opponent. Eithan even ushered them out with a bow, as though he were aware that their battle was only a simulation that was now coming to an end.\nDross coughed and avoided Orthos\u2019 gaze. [Well, you could call that progress! I\u2019m saying you could, not necessarily that I would.]\nOrthos growled and wondered if he could hit Dross with Blackflame. \u201cThis is not fair. How are we supposed to defeat Eithan?\u201d\nHe had seen Eithan erase stars. That was not an opponent, that was a global disaster.\n[This is a projection of Eithan as he was at Overlord. He\u2019s not using any of his\u2026] Dross waggled his arms. [\u2026incomprehensible outer-reality nonsense.]\n\u201cWe\u2019re exhausted!\u201d Orthos barked. \u201cLook at Blue!\u201d\nLittle Blue was lying on her back and gasping for breath. She tried to sit up at the sound of her name but chimed in frustration when she failed.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t get tired in there. How are we supposed to fight if he can keep going forever?\u201d\n[He can\u2019t. He has the same stamina limits as Eithan did at Overlord. He would have been tired if you had, you know\u2026tired him.]\nOrthos glared at Dross but could find no flaw with his logic. That didn\u2019t make the situation any less frustrating.\nIn the months they\u2019d spent inside Ghostwind Hall, Orthos had only managed to advance to Overlord. By normal standards, Overlord in a matter of months would be an impossible feat, but they were pushing for greater miracles.\nFighting an Overlord Eithan should have been an even match. Better, technically, since Blue was at a level comparable to Archlord. Not that she could express that in her techniques, most of the time.\nIn frustration, Orthos looked around for something to snack on, but the sparring hall into which Dross had projected his mental simulation had no rocks, no useless furniture, not even a crunchy mouthful of pebbles.\n[I have a great model of Eithan at Underlord!] Dross suggested. [Why don\u2019t you start with that? Although\u2026he did defeat a veiled Monarch in nine seconds. Hm. I could take a guess about what he was like at Gold?]\nOrthos seethed. The only thing more frustrating than his wounded pride was the knowledge that he had no excuses.\nIf they were going up against Monarchs and Dreadgods, then they were fighting opponents that couldn\u2019t be exhausted or outlasted. A mere Overlord, no matter how skilled, was little better than a Copper on that scale.\nDross floated over to him and placed a tentacle on the back of his neck in a friendly gesture. [Hey, I know it\u2019s tough. You were the first to collapse in the willpower training, you\u2019re the least advanced, and all your friends have passed you by. You know you need the most help, and you feel inadequate. Insecure. In\u2026flated. No, that one doesn\u2019t work. Incompetent!]\nOrthos wanted to lash out at Dross, but he closed his eyes instead. \u201cYes.\u201d\nLittle Blue gave him a soothing pat on the leg.\n[And what about you?] Dross asked Blue. [How do you feel about this?]\nLittle Blue\u2019s response was the urgent tinkling of a bell. She was impatient.\n[Well, if it means that much to you both\u2026I could technically speed up your training regimen.]\nBoth Orthos and Little Blue turned to him.", "c200a71a-9adc-455d-bb19-3069db96081f": "[Hey, I know it\u2019s tough.

Orthos was skeptical. \u201cPutting us in the training room against Eithan more often isn\u2019t going to help us.\u201d\n[No, I mean you\u2019ve both been on the diet Lindon has prepared for you. We scheduled that out with some margin for error. If you stick with the current schedule, you definitely won\u2019t lose your identity and go insane. We could put you on a faster plan, if you\u2019d like.]\n\u201cWould we lose our identities and go insane?\u201d\nDross beamed. [Only maybe!]\n\u201cHow big of a chance?\u201d\n[That depends on how much faster you go!]\nOrthos had been burned from the inside out by Blackflame before. He didn\u2019t like even the possibility of losing himself again.\n\u201cLindon has the black dragon Remnants locked away,\u201d Orthos pointed out. Lindon had moved Orthos\u2019 training materials to a locked void key when Orthos had lost himself after a particularly rough transfer of will and memories. He had tried to rush inside and fight all the remaining Remnants himself.\nDross whistled nonchalantly and spun a ring of keys around his tendril. After a moment, he said, [These are not real keys, you understand. They are an illustration to let you know that I\u2019m allowed to unlock his void key. I\u2019m not even the real Dross, just a temporary copy left to operate these illusion constructs. Is this too much for you? Should I slow down?]\n\u201cI understood.\u201d Orthos looked to Little Blue.\nShe bit her lower lip, and her shoulders were hunched. He couldn\u2019t sense her feelings as clearly as Lindon could, but she was nervous.\nHowever, she still gave a decisive nod.\n[Delightful! We can try the Eithan training again once you\u2019re around peak Overlord. Or maybe higher. He\u2019s tough.]\nBut if Orthos couldn\u2019t beat an Overlord-level Eithan, and two-on-one at that, there was no way he could fight the Wandering Titan.\nFirmly, he fixed his goal in his mind.\nFirst, Eithan.\nThen, he could fight by Lindon\u2019s side again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nOutside Sacred Valley, Akura Charity looked up at the titanic figure of gray-white madra that blotted out the sky. It straddled mountains, the ring of light around the closest peak hovering only around its knee.\nIt gave off a pressure that was more than merely spiritual. The Heart Icon stilled at the sight of this imposing, imperial figure, and she knew its name.\nThis was the Hollow King.\nWhen it swept three Monarchs aside with a sweep of its cloak and a thrust of its spear, Charity was unsurprised. For as far as she could sense, other powers went quiet at the passage of the Hollow King\u2019s madra.\nAnd this was only an echo. A memory, preserved in the labyrinth.\nHow powerful was the real thing?\nMalice had taken the brunt of its technique and had been driven out of the battle. Now was the chance for the lesser sacred artists, like Charity, to strike.\nEven after the Hollow King projection dispersed, no one moved to fight.\nThe Winter Sage, at Charity\u2019s side, spoke in unconcealed awe. \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d\n\u201cOur jobs,\u201d Charity responded automatically, but she was equally disturbed. Still, she didn\u2019t let that touch her tone as she began ordering Archlords. \u201cHalf of you with me and half with Min Shuei. We need to keep pressure on the labyrinth\u2019s defenses. Begin with any techniques that may not be repelled by a barrier against violent force.\u201d\nAkura Justice gave her an astonished, wide-eyed look.

Now, we have no more time to waste.\u201d\nThe Monarchs had already recovered and begun preparing their next round of techniques. While Lindon and the labyrinth had to be meeting their limits too, she had to assume their window would close any second.\nMin Shuei straightened up, eyes alight with passion, her white hair streaming behind her, and sword drawn. \u201cArchlords, with me! We strike from the front!\u201d\nHalf a dozen Archlords, powerful figures all, followed her with much less enthusiasm.\nCharity turned to Justice and her own team. \u201cLet\u2019s hope she catches his attention. We\u2019ll strike from the flanks.\u201d\nHer team looked much happier than the Winter Sage\u2019s had.\nStriker techniques traded overhead, scorching the air and sending the aura trembling for miles, but this could be considered a casual exchange on the level of Monarchs.\nWhich was the level it seemed Lindon had reached. At least, with the aid of the labyrinth.\nCharity and her Archlords reached the southern entrance into Sacred Valley, near a mountain that now gushed with a red river that reminded her strongly of blood. Prior to the Wandering Titan\u2019s attack, this place had probably been all but impassable, but wide passages had opened in the repeated earthquakes.\nThe aura was also significantly stronger now, so Charity and her Archlords flew in at full speed, coming to a halt a healthy distance from the protection scripts.\nCharity conjured a pair of owls, layering mental techniques into them. \u201cLet the Monarchs do battle with him outright. We will see if we can influence him more subtly. Even a moment of his attention taken\u2014\u201d\nShe cut herself off when she saw Lindon standing in the fractured passage before them.\nHe was a mile away, but everyone on the team had advanced to Archlord. They could see him clearly.\nThe young, powerfully built man had hands clasped behind his back and wintersteel badge clear on his chest. He surveyed them with black-and-white eyes, staying behind his protective script formation.\nMost of the Archlords prepared Enforcer techniques.\n\u201cI had hoped you would be on my side, Charity,\u201d Lindon said quietly.\nCharity ignored him, speaking to the rest of her team. \u201cA Silent King illusion. Continue as before. This technique is not dangerous without the protection of the labyrinth.\u201d\nLindon raised an eyebrow at that and casually stepped across the boundary of Sacred Valley.\nA moment later, he stood in their midst. The air trembled, though the Archlords held up admirably to the pressure. They shouted, crashing onto him with techniques from six different Paths.\nThey were wiped out by a Hollow Domain.\nBlue-white light that was almost solid erased the techniques. The feel of the Void Icon was powerful with Lindon.\nAnd he was just an illusion.\nHis gaze stayed on Charity. \u201cYou know what I\u2019m doing. Don\u2019t stop me.\u201d\nFor the Akura clan, Charity stayed strong. \u201cIf you can carry a message back to your real self, then tell him this: we can have this discussion peacefully.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t attack your home,\u201d Lindon said.\nThat shook Charity more than she let on, but she continued. \u201cWe must stop you from killing the Weeping Dragon.

Not because she couldn\u2019t think of one.\nBecause, in her heart, she felt that he was right.\n\u201cEnough!\u201d Akura Justice shouted. He Forged Strings of Shadow, launching them at Lindon. The Path of the Chainkeeper erupted into three separate techniques, tearing at Lindon with force and shadow in attacks that were both spiritual and physical.\nLindon\u2019s illusion let itself be torn apart. It tried to say one more thing, but Justice seized it by the hair and pulled the young man\u2019s head off.\nThe wounds disappeared, fading to the disturbing white light of the Silent King\u2019s madra. She wasn\u2019t sure precisely how Lindon had borrowed its powers. Moving the Dreadgod\u2019s core binding into a bow should have altered its functions, but perhaps this was a different construct.

When she\u2019d seen Lindon approach her, she had recognized it as an illusion, but had ordered an immediate attack instead of talking with him.\nThe fake Lindon was giving her no end of frustration.\nShe had seen the Silent King project illusions solid enough to trade blows with Monarchs, only to fade away when they finally struck him. Lindon\u2019s weren\u2019t quite on that level, but the fact that he could fight in so many ways at the same time scratched her pride.\nBlackflame burst through an Archlady\u2019s shield, the Empty Palm disarmed an Archlord\u2019s puppet construct, and a brief flash of the Hollow Domain wiped out two quick Striker techniques. He seized another Archlady with his right arm and began to Consume.\nShe cut that off with a quick slash of her sword, forcing him to release his prey. The illusion was made with a hunger madra aspect, so it could actually Consume madra to sustain itself.\nWhich wasn\u2019t its most irritating aspect.\nThe worst part, at least to Min Shuei, was how much he kept talking.\n\u201cI need the Monarchs gone,\u201d he said. \u201cNot you.\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d\nHis flying sword, Wavedancer, pushed away an Archlord water artist. Lindon leapt on another, hungry for power.\n\u201cBreak!\u201d Min Shuei commanded.\nThe illusion shivered and distorted, but it was too substantial for her to shred so easily. It snapped back into form, though her disruption allowed Lindon\u2019s prey to escape.\n\u201cYerin would be disappointed in you,\u201d Lindon said.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand anything!\u201d\nFurious, Min Shuei unleashed the binding in her sword.\nEverything inside a hundred yards, including many of her allies, were frozen by her power. Madra, aura, and authority locked everything she could reach, and razor-sharp snowflakes were Forged to hover in midair.\nHer allied Archlords would resist the technique to some degree, thanks to her control on their behalf, but Lindon was locked down.\nStill, he continued speaking. \u201cWork with me. I can put the Dreadgods down for good.\u201d\nMin Shuei gave a wild laugh and whipped a Striker technique at him. He stopped the slash, but his illusion was coming apart. \u201cNo, you can\u2019t! Nobody can! Do you think you\u2019re the first to try?\u201d\nLindon lost an arm to her next attack, but he calmly kept fighting. And talking. \u201cI can do it.\u201d\n\u201cThen prove it.\u201d\nWith that, Min Shuei tore the illusion of Silent King madra apart.\nShe released her lockdown on the space and the snowflakes began to disperse. Several of her Archlords gave sighs of relief. The Winter Sage looked deeper into Sacred Valley, resolve burning in her.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a true Dreadgod yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWithout his labyrinth and his bow, he is only a Sage. A Sage with too high an opinion of himself. Follow me, and we\u2019ll bring him down before the Monarchs do.\u201d\nBoldly, she flew toward Sacred Valley\u2019s border.\nShe came to a violent halt in midair when a shadow passed over her.\nNot a physical shadow.

It had entered a lull, Malice and Northstrider content to lock Lindon in place. Every second they stole from him was a gain.\nBut Reigan couldn\u2019t take that game anymore. He wanted to win something.\nHe stretched his perception north.\nThe storm-clouds of the Weeping Dragon were visible now, at least to him, and the Dreadgod\u2019s overwhelming power deafened him to detail.\nBut if the entrance to Lindon\u2019s pocket world wasn\u2019t in Sacred Valley, it would be there. And he was the best sacred artist in the world at tracking down spatial manipulation.\nHe set off north.

Shining storm-dragons, constructions of the Dreadgod, swooped out from the underside of the clouds or dove down to consume prey.\nAbove them all, the Weeping Dragon soared through the sky. Lindon could feel its power and its pride. It was coming for him, and it had absorbed almost as much power from the Silent King\u2019s death as he had. It would be taking the Slumbering Wraith\u2019s arm back.\nWindfall had been left in its path. The others would be able to escape before the Dreadgod arrived, but he wasn\u2019t sure they could advance by then. Not without his help.\nHe desperately wanted time to prepare, but the Monarchs were determined not to give him any. Hunger echoes of Malice and Reigan Shen fended off Striker techniques from the real Malice as Northstrider fought off the echo of himself and of three other Heralds.\nThe real Reigan Shen hadn\u2019t resurfaced after Ozmanthus destroyed his vaults, which was fortunate. The only reason the echoes had held out so long was because of Lindon\u2019s support.\nAnd because the objective of these Monarchs was to pin him here. Neither had shown the true extent of their power.\nIf they did, Lindon would be forced to unleash the labyrinth\u2019s greatest weapons. None of them wanted to risk that, and the Monarchs were content to lock him in place, so it was a stalemate.\nNot that it looked like one from the outside. The land for miles around was a scorched ruin wracked with aura-storms. Combined with all the recent Dreadgod attacks, Lindon doubted the region would recover for decades.\nDross, what do we have left? Lindon asked. He was currently suppressing Malice\u2019s spatial travel while sending dragon\u2019s breath sweeping at Northstrider and preparing a Void Dragon\u2019s Dance. None of it was going to do any real damage to his enemies, but he had to at least keep them on their toes.\n[Echoes? I don\u2019t want to say none, because that isn\u2019t true, but no significantly useful ones except for the ones involved in our\u2026Ultimate Solution.]\nLindon didn\u2019t support that name, but Dross had called the plan something different every time. He meant their last resort; the emergency measure they wanted to save in case the Weeping Dragon made it all the way here.\n[Some of the hunger bindings are damaged and will need our attention, since the restoration authority in the labyrinth is strained as it is. You can imagine why. It\u2019s because of all the damage.]\nWhat about the suppression field?\n[We can\u2019t set up the suppression field again without physically rearranging the power cores. It\u2019s actually an inversion of the standard system. As it is, we have several layers of defensive scripts, but activating them will be a significant drain on our power. The Titan took a big bite out of us, and the Dragon will hit Windfall before sunset.]\nMalice put an arrow through the hunger-ghost of Reigan Shen at virtually the same moment Northstrider kicked his clone out of the atmosphere. Lindon pressured Malice with dragon\u2019s breath, but at this rate, the Monarchs would be done with the echoes in a matter of seconds.\nThey were reluctant to enter the range of the labyrinth\u2019s authority for the same reason that Lindon didn\u2019t want to leave it. He couldn\u2019t do much except Forge echoes and send them out or launch Striker techniques from within the Valley.\nThis was like a bet between them. Lindon was betting that he would have backup if he stalled long enough, and they were betting he wouldn\u2019t.\nBut he didn\u2019t like this kind of back-and-forth deadlock. There had to be a way to get them to retreat so he could go back and help.\nI\u2019m not sure I can use the Bow again. Lindon said. He had almost passed out last time, and it was hard to recover his mental strength with the Dreadgod weapon still raging in his soulspace.\n[I didn\u2019t think you could use it last time,] Dross responded. [We have to engage the labyrinth defe\u2014oh look, they\u2019re proving my point. So helpful.]\nEven before Northstrider and Malice finished off the echoes, they began building up attacks that lit the sky. Lindon and Sacred Valley were pincered on two sides by a shining blood dragon and a star condensed onto the end of an arrow.\nLindon activated more of the labyrinth script\u2019s defenses.

He had no choice. Invisible walls sprang up around the border of the Valley.\nThe walls would hold against straightforward attacks, but the Weeping Dragon could break them. And they wouldn\u2019t stop mental attacks, poison clouds, or even shadows. He had other defenses for that.\nBut the Monarchs could always cycle through more abilities. Left alone, they would find their way through any static defenses. Northstrider had already summoned his oracle codex and begun calculating a better method of attack.\nLindon cycled his madra. \u201cAre you ready, Dross?\u201d\n[Yes. Absolutely. As long as you don\u2019t need to fight for more than a few seconds.]\n\u201cLet\u2019s take it one second at a time.\u201d\nLindon had a script-circle they couldn\u2019t penetrate at his back. He was the one with the fortress, which was a tactical advantage.\nHe\u2019d leaned on that advantage to make it this far.\nLindon left Sacred Valley and shot through the air at Northstrider, but anything short of slipping through space was slow for an attack on a Monarch. Northstrider had plenty of time to see Lindon coming, sneer at him for it, change techniques, and meet Lindon with a punch that could crack the world.\nDross showed him all that before it happened.\nLindon would have loved to transport himself behind Northstrider, but he didn\u2019t have anything as handy as the Moonlight Bridge. If he used his Sage authority to approximate a similar effect, Northstrider would override him.\nInstead, Lindon ignited the Soul Cloak and kicked off a platform of wind aura, slipping aside Northstrider\u2019s punch and preparing one of his own.\nThe black orb over Northstrider\u2019s shoulder flickered with power, and the future changed.\n[Redirect!] Dross shouted.\nLindon pulled himself up short, so Northstrider\u2019s punch scraped by him. The impact kicked up a hurricane\u2019s worth of wind, tearing a path through a nearby aura-storm.\nThe Empty Palm landed on nothing, then a Forged dragon rushed at Lindon and was torn apart by his Dreadgod arm.\nThey exchanged half a dozen moves in an instant, but neither landed a clean hit. Two opponents who could predict the other.\nDross called the time limit and Lindon shot back into the boundary. Northstrider tried to stop him, but Lindon slipped through a weak point in the barrier just as an arrow from Malice blasted through the space where he\u2019d been standing.\nThe echoes had stalled her a little longer than Northstrider, but not long enough. Without Dross, Lindon wouldn\u2019t have made it out without a hole through him. But without Dross, Lindon wouldn\u2019t have tried going out there at all.\nHe cycled power through the Heart of Twin Stars, breaking down everything he\u2019d Consumed from Northstrider in their brief exchange.\nFrom outside the invisible barrier, he saw Northstrider doing the same thing.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a child carrying weapons too heavy for him,\u201d the Monarch said. \u201cGive them up before they drag you down.\u201d\nDid you get that? Lindon asked Dross.\n[Not yet I didn\u2019t. You know how few of his thoughts I read from that? Steal more!]\nLindon looked from Malice to Northstrider. \u201cHow about we duel for them?\u201d\nMalice\u2019s armor faded away and she gave a pleasant laugh. \u201cA fair fight, then? Of course!

His primary plan will be to use the labyrinth, which has several functions that can reach beyond the boundaries. His backup will be a clash of authority. As the creator and bearer of a Dreadgod weapon and a limb from the Slumbering Wraith, he most likely believes his authority over hunger madra will give him an edge in your clash.\nWill it? Northstrider asked. Such things were often vague.\nThe codex\u2019s response was confident. Not enough. While his body has properties similar to a Dreadgod\u2019s, giving him power that in some ways exceeds that of a Monarch, he is not one. Your willpower is more refined and better able to conduct your authority. In fact, his attempt to control you will present an opening you can exploit.\nAnd what about Dross?\nWe cannot know for sure. The model of him was complete, but it is difficult to know how much he benefited from the madra of the Silent King. Even so, any possibility in which he out-performs me is very remote.\nEven considering the ability of the Void Icon to shroud possible futures, that was a reassuring analysis. Northstrider had utmost confidence in his oracle codex.\nIn the end, Dross was a spirit. His codex was a weapon, optimized for performance. Even considering Dross\u2019 flexibility, a head-to-head contest between the two would have favorable results more often than not.\nNorthstrider showed none of his thoughts on his face or in his spirit, and the calculations of his codex took no time. He waited a moment longer, as though pondering, as his codex gave him the oath he needed to swear.\n\u201cI will swear to duel you,\u201d he said at last. \u201cBut we fight to death, surrender, or the arrival of the Weeping Dragon. I will not call for or allow any outside assistance, if you swear the same. But that must include the labyrinth.\u201d\nMalice turned to him with shock that he was sure was feigned. She knew Northstrider well enough to realize that if he accepted seemingly unfavorable conditions, he had a trick left.\nLindon also tried to give nothing away, but there was a faint twitching in his face that the codex interpreted as suppressed relief. His eyes flickered slightly, as though he wanted to look to the Weeping Dragon and check how much time was left.\nHe believes these conditions favor him, the codex said. He will propose that you and Malice must back away from Sacred Valley if he wins.\n\u201cPrizes,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cThe winner should get something.\u201d\n\u201cYour bow,\u201d Northstrider said immediately. The real prize would be Lindon\u2019s defeat, at which point Northstrider could take whatever he wanted, but he would clearly establish what was on the line in case their duel was interrupted by the Weeping Dragon.\nThe Silent King Bow was the most powerful object Lindon owned that he could feasibly transfer as a prize. Northstrider would rather have the labyrinth or Dross, but Lindon couldn\u2019t hand those over so easily.\n\u201cMy daughter,\u201d Malice added.\nLindon and Northstrider turned to her, and Northstrider was sure they both felt the same irritation. Malice gave a shameless smile. \u201cYou need me to agree as well, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nLindon won\u2019t make that bet, the oracle codex predicted.\n\u201cI will not turn Mercy over,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cBut I will separate her from the Book of Eternal Night and return that to you.\u201d\nNorthstrider didn\u2019t give anything away, but that surprised him.", "a56b7941-1435-49a1-8418-64f588b0b09d": "The Silent King Bow was the most powerful object Lindon owned that he could feasibly transfer as a prize.

The oracle codex absorbed this new information and added it to Lindon\u2019s model.\nMalice\u2019s smile gained an ugly shadow, but she gave a brief nod.\n\u201cHowever, if I have to pay out twice, so do you. If I win, you both return to Moongrave until the Weeping Dragon is defeated or I am.\u201d\n\u201cTo a maximum of three days,\u201d Northstrider added, before the oracle codex had a chance to add it in. He wasn\u2019t going to be trapped in one city because of a loophole in an oath, nor was he going to let Lindon drag him into a week-long battle. Not that he expected Lindon to want such a thing, but he had endured such fights before.\n\u201cAgreed.\u201d Lindon extended his right hand. \u201cShake on it?\u201d\nNorthstrider gave the Dreadgod arm a disgusted look.\nLindon shrugged. \u201cApologies. I do so swear upon my soul to abide to the conditions in good faith.\u201d\n\u201cI swear,\u201d Northstrider and Malice said at the same time.\nThen Malice faded into shadow as the clash between Northstrider\u2019s fist and Lindon\u2019s shattered space.\nLindon was blasted down and away from Sacred Valley like a meteorite, as Northstrider intended. However advanced Lindon was, a Sage couldn\u2019t keep up with a Monarch who had manifested the Strength Icon, though of course his Dreadgod arm didn\u2019t break under the impact.\nNorthstrider stayed on him, tearing through the air. His oracle codex gave him two possibilities: Lindon would either launch Striker techniques to create more space even as he flew backward, or he would begin building up power for a larger strike.\nIt was the latter. Blackflame gathered around his left hand, condensing and Forging into the tips of claws.\nThat had been a mistake. The strength of a thousand dragons flowed through the Enforcer technique Northstrider funneled into his fists, until his punch was surrounded by a transparent, blood-red dragon.\nLindon was already moving to dodge, as the oracle codex couldn\u2019t surpass Dross\u2019 predictive ability enough to allow him to land a clean hit.\nSo Northstrider relied on his own authority. He was the superior here. His words should be obeyed. All bowed before him, including Lindon.\nThat certainty resonated with the Strength Icon and with the Dragon Icon. Only the strongest reigned, and he was the strongest.\nIt lent weight to his command when he ordered Lindon to \u201cStop.\u201d\nLindon shivered as he struggled against the working of authority, and his will was anything but weak. Even so, he had to spend a split-second of his attention resisting. His Dreadgod hand started to Consume the energy radiating off Northstrider, but those sips of power wouldn\u2019t be enough to help him.\nCarrying enough force to crack mountains, Northstrider\u2019s punch landed on Lindon\u2019s ribs.\nBy all rights, a direct hit from Northstrider should have disintegrated a Sage. His oracle codex told him what to expect from Lindon, though. Not only had his flesh been partially integrated with a Dreadgod\u2019s, but he\u2019d used that very arm to feed on the vitality and blood essence of the Wandering Titan and the Silent King.\nHe wouldn\u2019t be torn to pieces\u2026but he wouldn\u2019t be unscathed. Sure enough, Northstrider felt ribs shattering under the impact, and Lindon\u2019s new black-and-white eyes widened in shock and pain. Before he shot away\u2014into the sky, this time\u2014he coughed up blood.\nThat was more satisfying than Northstrider had expected.\nThe oracle codex predicted Lindon\u2019s retaliation: a fully empowered Hollow Domain to create space while he healed. When blue-white madra exploded into a sphere around Lindon, Northstrider tore through the technique with the help of a Forged dragon, slicing his way closer.\nLindon ducked him and Consumed the Forger technique, but that created an opening for Northstrider to kick him in the back.", "17090b4b-1b2f-4054-b4ca-073b1c1b7d12": "He wouldn\u2019t be torn to pieces\u2026but he wouldn\u2019t be unscathed.

His spine cracked while Northstrider\u2019s blood-and-hunger madra ravaged him internally.\nWhy is he using Consume so recklessly? Northstrider asked. This was at least the second time that Lindon had shown him a gap so that he could Consume some power, but the Void Sage had lost out wildly in both exchanges. He would need more power than he stole just to fuel his Bloodforged Iron body.\nThe oracle codex had an instant answer, of course. Lindon was aiming to establish authority over hunger. If he could make such a command with Northstrider\u2019s madra in him, it would be more effective.\nNeither Northstrider nor the codex could think of another explanation, especially since Lindon was still concentrating madra in his left hand. His hand was gloved in Forged madra and was starting to trail fire and destruction aura.\nNorthstrider sent Striker techniques thundering after Lindon, and he felt a faint regret. No matter how many unique advantages Lindon had, inexperience would always show itself. Lindon was clinging to what he saw as his one chance of winning: creating an opening with hunger authority and then finishing Northstrider off with The Dragon Descends.\nEven if that would work, Lindon would take too much of a beating while setting up. An experienced opponent would know that.\nNorthstrider\u2019s regret turned to anger. If Lindon hadn\u2019t let his identity as the Destroyer\u2019s apprentice go to his head, he wouldn\u2019t have challenged the Monarchs, and then he might have been a great asset.

He would teach a lesson that Lindon would be lucky to survive.\nThe next few seconds were a farce of a battle. Lindon sent black dragon\u2019s breath thundering through the air, of a power Northstrider hadn\u2019t seen since he\u2019d last slain a black dragon Herald. The boy slipped aside from some of Northstrider\u2019s attacks, no doubt guided by Dross\u2019 predictions. He broke or endured several techniques, Consuming breaths of power and will from them.\nBut Northstrider stripped far more power from Lindon than he lost. Flesh was torn from Lindon\u2019s legs, though he endured the agony and regenerated them. Bones were shattered, blood flew, and Lindon\u2019s spirit was in chaos. His soulfire dipped low, and his will lost its iron strength. Even the technique layered over his left hand wasn\u2019t growing anymore; it was all Lindon could do to maintain it.\nNorthstrider almost didn\u2019t want to continue. His disgust was too much.\nOrdinarily, anyone tough enough to trade blows with him had the skill to back it up. A weaker opponent would have died already, but someone with proportional experience would be more of a threat.\nThis felt like bullying a child.\nThe oracle codex checked Fate and confirmed that the flow of events was heading without deviation toward a victory of Northstrider\u2019s. There was virtually no other outcome.\nNot that Northstrider needed a complex fortune-telling device to tell him that.\nA serpentine blood dragon grabbed Lindon in its jaws and crashed into the ground, slamming him into a crater that grew deeper and deeper. The oracle codex showed Northstrider that he could follow up and tear Lindon in half, but he stopped in midair.\nHe hovered over the young man.

Lindon was holding onto the Blackflame claws in his left hand, and his spirit was still chewing away at the power he\u2019d taken from Northstrider. He was a sack of bloody skin over crushed, misshapen bones, and his eyes rolled aimlessly as he tried to focus.\nMalice giggled, but Northstrider didn\u2019t feel anything but revulsion and frustration. He had warned Lindon repeatedly.\nHe\u2019ll try an attack, the codex warned him, highlighting the danger. Northstrider dropped from the air. He slammed his foot into Lindon\u2019s left wrist, and Lindon cried out.\nHis Blackflame technique shuddered like a candle on the verge of being extinguished. Lindon reached up and grabbed Northstrider\u2019s leg with his right hand, attempting to Consume.\nNorthstrider didn\u2019t allow it to happen.\nThe oracle codex scoffed. He\u2019s too weak. Definitely. We\u2019re in the clear. It showed him the future, spinning out in an unbroken line: Northstrider tucking away the Silent King Bow and binding Lindon in oaths.\nNorthstrider would have the labyrinth, the Dreadgod weapon, and Dross. With those together, he could finish his projects and challenge the Abidan.\nEven he felt his heart move with excitement. He owed Lindon some gratitude for this foolishness. Without it, he might have taken\u2014\nSomething tickled the back of his mind, and he returned his attention to the oracle codex.\nRepeat what you said, Northstrider ordered.\nLindon\u2019s Consume technique was too weak to feed on Northstrider. The Dreadgod arm pulled at Northstrider\u2019s ankle again, but nothing came through.\nI, uh, I said he\u2019s too weak. What\u2019s the problem?\nThe oracle codex was a calculation device. Not a person.\nAnd it did not speak like one.\nOops, the codex said. Would you believe me if I said I\u2019ve advanced in the middle of battle? No?\nNorthstrider would be a fool if he didn\u2019t recognize the voice now. He pulled his leg away from Lindon\u2026and found he couldn\u2019t.\n[Game\u2019s up, Lindon,] the oracle codex said in Dross\u2019 voice.\nLindon\u2019s eyes snapped open, and his willpower wasn\u2019t as exhausted as Northstrider had thought.\nSuddenly, Northstrider realized Malice had been speaking to him, but he hadn\u2019t heard it.

Malice hoped it wouldn\u2019t work this time\u2026but her spirit tightened at even the thought of turning her bow on Lindon.\nThe duel really wasn\u2019t over. The possibility remained that Northstrider could have his own trump card and turn the tables, and she knew it.\nMore importantly, she knew that Lindon couldn\u2019t take on Northstrider like that without losing something. The boy might be in worse shape than he looked and could die on his own before Northstrider did.\nWith those possibilities still clear, she couldn\u2019t violate her oath.\nShe scanned him with the full force of her perception, but she sensed little besides chaos.

Madra thundered through his channels and stuck in his Dreadgod arm, a will equal to Lindon\u2019s own tried to wrestle control away, and the strength stored in his body was like nothing Lindon had felt short of a Dreadgod.\nEven his memories were heavier than usual, so that Lindon was buried in their sheer weight. Dross handled as many as he could, but the mind-spirit was at his limit too.\n[I\u2019m\u2026not going to be\u2026good for much,] Dross said, his mental voice strained. [Not unless we want\u2026to kill me again. Which we don\u2019t.

Especially doing it while hiding from the Monarch, which had also taken a massive working of the Void Icon.\nAs for Lindon, he barely had a thought to spare about Dross. All his attention was going to the Heart of Twin Stars as it divided the spiritual river they\u2019d drained from Northstrider into tiny streams of many colors.\nHe was only holding on by the tips of his fingers. For their ruse to work, he\u2019d needed to deceive Northstrider into thinking the fight was over.\nThe trick to deceiving Monarchs, he\u2019d found out, was to make your lie ninety percent true.\nHis will really was strained, his body ravaged. Using a Dreadgod weapon while manipulating the labyrinth was a heavy enough burden, and to duel a Monarch afterward\u2026he still had plenty of madra left, but that was virtually the only resource he wasn\u2019t out of.\nThe weight of Northstrider\u2019s energy was settling into him. His Bloodforged Iron body had seen to his wounds and supported the Heart of Twin Stars in processing blood essence. It seeped into his muscles and bones, bolstering them.\nThe stolen authority of the Dragon Icon raged through him. He could see what Orthos meant now; the nature of a dragon was in more than their natural instincts and inborn strength. It was the arrogance and certainty of being born a higher being.\nAnd with it came power.\nNorthstrider\u2019s memories were a waterfall of images and impressions, but Lindon had to let them go without inspection. There were surely lifetimes of lessons within, but even a fraction of Northstrider\u2019s knowledge was like having a thousand books crammed into his mind at once. If he tried to dive in, he would be overwhelmed.\nDross could sort the memories later, when he recovered. There would be treasures buried in Northstrider\u2019s mind.\nThat thought was a spark of delight in Lindon\u2019s soul. He still struggled to separate the forces he\u2019d absorbed, but he had crested the hill. It would only get easier from here.\nHe had done it. Bested a Monarch. And not just any Monarch, but Northstrider; the creator of Ghostwater, and one of the first Monarchs Suriel had shown him on her world tour.\nHe could level Sacred Valley on his own, she had told him, and you could save it, if you had skills and powers like his.\nNow, he did.\nWhen Lindon fully processed what he\u2019d stolen, the gap between them would only grow.\nOr\u2026\nHe could hold on. While it would be difficult to do so, the authority of the Dragon Icon would be invaluable for Orthos. He could give Ziel some more memories, and Northstrider\u2019s madra would be compatible with Yerin\u2019s.\nAs he thought of his friends, he stretched his awareness north.\nAt which point he froze in sudden fear.\nOrdinarily Dross would have warned him first, but the mind-spirit was busy. He noticed a second later than Lindon did, and then they shared the same alarm.\nReigan Shen was approaching Windfall.\nKing\u2019s Key madra burned against Lindon\u2019s perception, coming closer and closer to the pocket world.\nWindfall was hidden as well as Lindon could hide anything, not to mention located over a random stretch of the Trackless Sea, but clearly Shen had found it. He was moving too quickly for this to be a coincidence.\nLindon had left constructs and other security measures, including some scaled for a Monarch, but they would only slow Shen, not stop him.

But at the same time, she also had to operate the blood madra inside her body in a way that resonated with its minor hunger aspect from the Phoenix.\nUsing one cycling technique at a time was hard enough. This was trying to play two different songs on two instruments at once. And making them not sound like a sack of squealing cats.\nAn angry hiss distracted her, along with a loud, insistent tapping sound.\nShe broke off her cycling and looked up, annoyed. The angular skeleton of blood madra drilled its sharpened fingers on a chalkboard, which was covered in complex notations.\n\u201cWould be about a thousand miles closer to easy if you would just talk,\u201d she pointed out for the hundredth time. \u201cYou\u2019re not tricking anybody.\u201d\nThe Blood Sage\u2019s Remnant somewhat resembled him in life: a crimson skeleton, though the spirit\u2019s skull had no eyes.

Crimson desire?\u201d\nThe Remnant picked up chalk and circled the word \u2018desire\u2019 three times.\n\u201cI\u2019d give my left arm to know why you\u2019re giving me the theoretical\u2026\u201d She only spent a second hunting for the right word before the spirit scribbled the word \u2018underpinnings.\u2019\n\u201c\u2026underpinnings of a cycling technique.\u201d\nWhen the spirit began furiously pointing from one word to another symbol, making a case once again for why she needed to learn the basis of the technique.\n\u201cI can already do it, can\u2019t I?

And because she still thought he deserved it.\nThe Remnant spat out air again, then used a cloth to wipe a small corner of the board clean. Quickly, he wrote out \u2018I killed your family.\u2019\nYerin\u2019s breath almost stopped.\nHe erased that and replaced it. \u2018I planted that Blood Shadow.\u2019\n\u201cWhat is this?

Remnants usually felt pain, but he wasn\u2019t showing any. Still with the same amount of irritation as before, the Sage\u2019s Remnant reached up with his one remaining hand and tapped the most common symbol on the board.\nIt meant \u2018cycle.\u2019\nYerin spared him another glare, but she dropped into a cycling position and began weaving all the elements together. Her Path of the Endless Sword cycling technique, modified to incorporate blood aura. Then the hunger technique they\u2019d cobbled together from the Blood Sage, from Redmoon the Herald, and from Northstrider\u2019s Consume.\nShe was in the process of juggling everything when she heard more tapping and briefly opened an eye.\nThe Remnant was re-absorbing his severed hand, but in the meantime, he tapped the sentence she\u2019d split in half. \u2018I would kill your family a thousand times again.\u2019\nHer spirit flared with anger and a desire to kill him.\nAnd the technique clicked into place.\nSuddenly it was like every separate piece had been designed to work together from the very beginning. It all fell into step like a regiment of trained soldiers, and a faint reddish haze appeared all over Yerin\u2019s body. Like crimson moonlight drifting into her skin.\nThe Remnant jabbed a finger in her direction.\nHer cycling technique wasn\u2019t stable yet, it fell apart quickly, but she finally understood what he had meant all along. Her attitude was the key piece.\nThe more she wanted to kill her opponent, the easier it would be to steal their power.

Lindon had kept them in storage for training, and knowing him, he\u2019d make them into constructs eventually.\nThe two spirits\u2014a blue one that looked like a half-liquid lobster and a sort of squat mechanical squirrel\u2014trembled at the feel of her spirit, but she gave them no attention. Yerin closed her eyes, aligning her breathing to the pattern of her new technique.\nIt took her a breath and a half longer than she wanted, but she got her madra moving. It still felt clunky, like trying to walk in a pair of shoes made for someone Lindon\u2019s size. Until she focused on her heart.\nShe wanted to kill them.\nThe technique lined up, but not perfectly. Not as it had with Red Faith. She focused harder.\nIt was the Monarchs she really wanted to kill. They were responsible for the Bleeding Phoenix staying alive at all.\nThat was a little better. She began to hear a sound, not like the distant sensation of an Icon, but like the song of a nearby Remnant. It was coming from her, but she didn\u2019t inspect it closer.\nEyes still shut, she pushed further.\nShe remembered Reigan Shen\u2019s face as he looked down on them in the labyrinth. When he hovered over Redmoon Hall and mocked her. She pictured Malice, treating Yerin like a worm on a hook. And doing worse to Mercy.\nThe sound burst into full song, and Yerin opened her eyes.\nSoft red moonlight drifted off her in a subtle aura, and a sound that reminded her of the Bleeding Phoenix\u2019s song drifted around her. Now, at last, this was more than just a cycling technique. She\u2019d finally pushed it into the shape she wanted.\nThe spirit Enforcer technique filled her, preparing her soul.\nWith one motion, Yerin cut the two Remnants in half. They weren\u2019t the ones she really wanted to kill, but this was a necessary step.\nWhen she slashed them to pieces, she braced herself. She thought she knew what to expect, having watched Lindon Consume more than his share of Remnants, dreadbeasts, and living sacred artists.\nInstead, the places where she\u2019d cut the Remnants turned red. Silver-red light burst from the wounds like chains, wrapping them all over and binding them in place.\nSuddenly, Yerin could feel them. They were connected to her, resonating with the hunger madra technique that flowed through her. Physical and mental strength flowed into her, as well as pieces of lifeline\u2014only trickles, considering that they were Underlords and Remnants, but better than nothing\u2014and Yerin was hit by a handful of faint memories and a splash of weak willpower.\nBreaking that willpower was easier than wrestling an earthworm, but Yerin felt confusion dilute her desire to kill. She hadn\u2019t gotten any madra.\nAnd the Remnants were still there.\nThe chains of her madra had pulled them back together, stitching them into the forms they had before she tore them up. They were weaker than before, having lost much of their strength to Yerin, and they looked like a couple of puppet-constructs bound together crudely with her madra.\nShe could feel them.", "d4a04d24-b83a-462c-9847-3c16f7d872a5": "Suddenly, Yerin could feel them.

Awkwardly, in the case of the blue lobster, which splashed every time it hit the ground.\nYerin stared. \u201cDross, give me the ten-word story of what I just did.\u201d\nDross materialized next to her, looking faint. The original had left this limited copy weeks ago, from her perspective at least, and it was running out of power.\n[First, let me remind you that you\u2019re the one who helped design the technique, and the original version of me has much greater\u2014]\n\u201cTen words, Dross.\u201d\nOne of the Remnants crumbled to nothing. She got an even smaller burst of energy, but most of its madra started to dissolve to essence.\nDross squinted his single eye as though counting words. [You take what you can, and the rest is captured.]\nYerin let her technique fade, thinking. She had based this on the Phoenix madra\u2019s ability to create bloodspawn, but she had been picturing something different. She\u2019d imagined draining power from the people she stabbed like they were bloodspawn delivering power to the Phoenix.\nRed Faith had seized on that concept and added his own designs to it, but it was still rare for a technique to work so differently to the user\u2019s imagination. As Yerin herself had once taught Lindon, the intentions behind a technique were one of the most important parts.\nDross floated up in front of her. [Would you like ten more words?]\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m stable. You can take a rest. And thanks.\u201d Now that she had an idea of how the technique was supposed to work, it would only get better from here. She could actually practice.\nThe second Remnant fell to pieces.\n[Oh! You thanked me! That feels good, you should do that more often.]\nShe frowned at him. \u201cI know how to thank people.\u201d\n[You didn\u2019t thank Eithan when he went up to the heavens,] Dross pointed out.\nYerin considered and tossed aside several responses. Her instinct was to hit back, but Lindon was gone, and everyone was working harder than they ever had. She needed someone to really talk to.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t know what to say, did I?\u201d she muttered at last. \u201cGone over that in my head a thousand and one times. Got a whole pack of things I could have said, should have said.\u201d\nDross\u2019 eye widened, and he stared at her from an inch in front of her nose.\n\u201c\u2026You trying to see into my brain?\u201d\n[That\u2019s more than I\u2019ve heard you open up to anyone but Lindon. This Phoenix Song technique has warped your thoughts. Not to be rude, but you should keep using it.]\nYerin took a step back herself, since Dross didn\u2019t seem like he was going to. \u201cPhoenix Song?\u201d\n[Makes sense, right? You sound all musical while you\u2019re using it, like your skin is singing. Hm. I don\u2019t like that description, for some reason.]\n\u201cPhoenix Song.\u201d She ran it through her head and nodded. \u201cI like it.\u201d\n[Are you sure? I could call the others! It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve voted on a name.]\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s all locked up. Thanks.\u201d\nDross threw up his tendrils. [Twice! I\u2019ve been thanked twice! My original won\u2019t even believe my memories.]\nFor a few more hours, Yerin practiced the Phoenix Song.

Weak Remnants didn\u2019t give her much benefit and only lasted for a snap before they crumbled to pieces.\nThen she went about the routine she\u2019d followed daily, while Lindon was gone: checking on the others.\nZiel was, as usual, sitting in front of the Paths of Heaven. He was seated in a cycling position on the ground, his green horns glowing and eyes shut, but he wasn\u2019t cycling. The fourth display was lit, the one that swirled with unreadable letters.\nShe found it the most confusing one, but Ziel said it helped him steer his Grand Oath Array.\nA loop of Forged silver runes spun around him, so complicated they made her eyes hurt just looking at them. More symbols hovered in the air above him, though they were only arranged in a circle by the loosest definition. Those runes flipped, shifted, and transported between one another like a Sage was juggling them through space.\nYerin entered quietly and waited until she was sure he sensed her presence before she spoke. \u201cYou ready for today\u2019s test?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to test it so often,\u201d Ziel responded without opening his eyes. \u201cBut yes.\u201d\nShe\u2019d brought a fruit for exactly this purpose, which had been grown in a small garden sustained by life aura. It resembled a pink-skinned apple, and she took a bite from it before she tossed it into the center of the network of spinning silver runes.\nIt froze in the middle like an invisible hand had caught the apple, but there were no flows of vital aura around it. Ziel\u2019s eyebrows wrinkled as he concentrated, and the fruit began to rot in seconds. It had just turned into mush when the script flickered, and the half-rotten mass of apple hit the ground with a splat.\nZiel gave a heavy sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to stay there until it\u2019s dust.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a stretch more than you could do yesterday,\u201d Yerin pointed out. \u201cAnd with you not being a Sage. That calls for cheers if you ask me.\u201d\nYerin thought she wouldn\u2019t get much more than a sigh out of him, or maybe a glum comment, but Ziel opened his eyes and gave her a firm nod.\n\u201cAlmost,\u201d he said. \u201cI am getting used to it. Soon, I think, I\u2019ll have something to really be proud of.\u201d\nThat was worth a smile, Yerin thought. \u201cNow you sound like a Sage.\u201d\n\u201cThe Monarch who invented this technique was killed by the Dreadgods,\u201d Ziel went on, \u201cso obviously I\u2019ll still have further to go.\u201d\nYerin\u2019s smile withered. \u201cIf you were happy about something, you think it might kill you?\u201d\n\u201cI am happy,\u201d Ziel said. He sounded confused, so Yerin turned away from him and activated one of the Paths of Heaven that didn\u2019t hurt her head so bad.\nThe last one.\nZiel flinched as the dark cave appeared, its darkness somehow thicker and deeper even than Mercy\u2019s shadow cycling room.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you even get close to that,\u201d he said.\nYerin walked up to the darkness, standing at the twilight edge. Absolute silence came from within, and she was certain that a single touch would mean her death.\nThe sensation was comforting, somehow. Not the thought of dying; Yerin meant to live forever.

You\u2019re welcome.\u201d\nYerin resolved to thank people more often.\nNext up was Orthos, whose training Yerin could hear from anywhere in Ghostwind Hall. Since Yerin had been using the sparring hall, he\u2019d moved down to one of the bigger empty caverns within the island of pale stone.\nWhen she arrived, she saw Orthos surrounding himself with the Burning Cloak and crashing against the Herald dragon Remnant.\nThe two slammed their heads together with a crash like an exploding boulder. Orthos\u2019 scalp split open, leaking blood.\n\u201cAgain!\u201d Orthos shouted.\nThe Remnant hesitated, and Orthos pounced on that hesitation immediately. His eyes shone a bright orange-red and he leaped up and over the spirit. He unleashed a flow of dragon\u2019s breath down on Noroloth\u2019s back.\nThe serpentine spirit twisted around and matched the Striker technique with dragon\u2019s breath of his own, but then Orthos slashed down with his right foreleg.\nBlackflame madra Forged quickly, forming claws, and Orthos slammed The Dragon Descends down.\nIf Noroloth hadn\u2019t been the Remnant of a Herald, the technique\u2019s explosion would have destroyed the cavern. Instead, he controlled the force and kept it from erupting into the walls.\nHe didn\u2019t stop the fire from washing over Yerin, so she did it herself.\n\u201cGood!\u201d the Remnant shouted. \u201cSoon, you will be an Archlord, and you will be worthy of my line!\u201d\nOrthos roared, and a void key opened nearby. Noroloth seized a struggling black-and-red dragon Remnant, hurling it toward Orthos.\nFrom Orthos\u2019 soulspace, he summoned a hunger construct over his jaws so that his mouth was filled with gray-white fangs of Forged hunger. Then he bit down.\nPower flowed from the Remnant up the teeth and into Orthos, lighting up scripts etched into the fangs. Orthos devoured the entire Overlord spirit in moments, pulling it to pieces and eating each one at a time.\nYerin had seen plenty of animals feeding on one another. Some of them were sacred beasts and others ordinary predators. But seeing Orthos do it was still a little revolting. She much preferred the look of Lindon\u2019s Consume technique.\nIt was cleaner. More\u2026elegant. At least, that\u2019s how Eithan would put it.\nOrthos shuddered as he fought against the flood of willpower and memories remaining in the Remnant. Without Lindon and Dross to filter them, he took the full brunt of their impact, though Yerin was sure the set of construct-teeth weren\u2019t as efficient as Lindon\u2019s arm.\nEven so, her own experience with hunger madra told her it would be a struggle, but Orthos only shuddered a little as he worked his way through the Remnant.\n\u201cIs it that time already?\u201d he asked Yerin in between bites.\n\u201cYou\u2019d have a better feel for the time if you had been sleeping.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not the time for rest.\u201d\n\u201cEh, that\u2019s a little shaky. Depends. You looking to swallow down all those memories, or you looking to lose your mind again?\u201d Yerin faced him down evenly, arms folded.

He lifted his chin and looked to her with dignity. \u201cIf I can be consumed from within by these lesser shades, then I was not strong enough to begin with.\u201d\nThe cavern shook as Noroloth laughed. He slithered over Orthos and glared down at Yerin. \u201cYou see, human? This is the attitude of a true dragon. My own blood. You would be wise not to doubt us.\u201d\nYerin eyed him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a lot of mouth for a pile of Blackflame scales.\u201d\n\u201cYour protector has been gone a long time.\u201d He loomed over her, his too-wide mouth baring teeth. \u201cThe rest of you take me too lightly. I am\u2014\u201d\nYerin took a stance. She had no trouble getting in the proper mindset for this one, not with the Herald\u2019s Remnant looming over her. And after staring into the darkness of Death.\nShe let the memory of Eithan\u2019s strike fill her, and the world grew silent.\nBefore she could swing, Noroloth crashed to the ground. His madra stilled completely, and he slunk toward her on his belly. \u201cI was kidding, of course, kidding! There\u2019s no need to take me so seriously! I am pleased to render what aid I can, and if there\u2019s more I can offer\u2026\u201d\nYerin let her technique fade half-formed. \u201cYou bark a lot more than you bite, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nNoroloth chuckled nervously, but he no longer had Yerin\u2019s attention. Orthos hadn\u2019t banished his hunger fangs, his eyes still burned, and his shell smoldered with Blackflame. From the feel of his madra, he was about to throw himself at her.\n\u201cTake a breath, Orthos,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI will not bow to a human,\u201d Orthos spat.\nYerin looked him over from nose to tail. On the outside, nothing had changed from his growth to the peak of Overlord. But she was here to watch for changes on the inside.\n\u201cYou tell me that was something you would have said before, and I\u2019ll cut you down for being a liar.\u201d\nBlackflame flared in his spirit, and she wondered if he was going to attack her. Her heart tightened. If he did, that would be her chance to beat some sense back into him, but it would also mean there was less of the Orthos she knew left than she thought.\nBut sense returned to his eyes, and he looked up from the floor. His face twisted in a grimace. \u201cI am sorry, Yerin. It is hard to remember myself, sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cI can go grab Blue, if you need her to put the fire out.\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cIt isn\u2019t Blackflame damage. It is what you said. I have fed too much. It makes me feel strong and helps me break down the wills of these little spirits. But I forget myself.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m stone-certain Lindon has something to help keep your memories.\u201d Yerin would bet a Monarch\u2019s entire fortune that Lindon had made something with that effect in the void key he\u2019d left behind.\nOrthos gave a skeptical rumble. \u201cIt is not that I confuse their memories for my own.

That was the needle stuck in her heart. The problem she had been trying to forget.\nThe others couldn\u2019t help Lindon in his fight. They were stuck here until they could face a Dreadgod.\nBut Yerin could. She could go out there and help him. Fight at his side.\nShe just couldn\u2019t help enough.\nIt would be easier if she couldn\u2019t do anything at all, or so she thought. Then she\u2019d have no choice but to stay put. Having the choice, and having to choose over and over again to do nothing, to be disciplined, to use time efficiently\u2026\nIt reminded her of her early days training the Endless Sword. A cut here, a nick there, that added up to a thousand little scars.\nHer brain must have been stuck for a moment, because Orthos nudged her with his snout before she realized it. The jaws of hunger madra had vanished, and he raised his head to meet her with kindness in his eyes. He was Orthos again.\n\u201cYou know what I feel from him?\u201d Orthos asked. \u201cStrength. And trust.\u201d\nEven with the time warping turned down low, every grain of sand that fell from the hourglass was another threat to Lindon\u2019s life. Yerin leaned her forehead against Orthos, feeling the warmth of his leathery skin.\n\u201cWhat if we don\u2019t make it?\u201d she asked quietly.\n\u201cHe knows we will. I have not felt a moment of doubt from him. Not one.\u201d\nThe rumble of his voice comforted her, and she tried to release the tension in her chest. After a second, she pulled back.\n\u201cHang on. Thought I was the one here to quiet you down.\u201d\nOrthos\u2019 chuckle released a mouthful of smoke. \u201cHow the wind turns. I will rest for the day. Remind me tomorrow when the time comes.\u201d He bumped her with the edge of his shell. \u201cAnd take that advice yourself.\u201d\nYerin had one more stop to make for the day before she could sleep\u2014or, more likely, before she could lie awake and worry for a few hours.\nMercy had set herself up in a corner of the island. With her hair tied back and her training clothes loose, she lounged in a hammock of her own creation, which she\u2019d strung between two buildings. She looked up at the multi-colored clouds and sipped a drink through a straw.\nMercy was the picture of a clan\u2019s young lady on holiday, but Yerin could sense the power of the elixir she was drinking. It was an Archlord-level brew they had recovered from the House Shen vaults, which Lindon had infused with a scale from Akura Malice.\nAbsorbing it gradually had helped Mercy adapt to the Book of Eternal Night, but she still grimaced with every sip. Elixirs weren\u2019t necessarily designed for flavor, but they weren\u2019t usually revolting. At least not the ones made by competent refiners.\nYerin suspected the energy reminded Mercy of her mother, which would explain the expression.\nLittle Blue was standing on Mercy\u2019s stomach, waving her arms and chiming rapidly as she explained something to Mercy.

Mercy gave her a sympathetic look and waved a hand, Forging a swing of black strings dangling from the overhang of a nearby roof.\n\u201cHave a seat! It\u2019s hard to rest when you\u2019re worried, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Mercy asked. \u201cI\u2019m sure we can find an elixir to relax you. Actually, I might have some myself. Aunt Charity makes\u2026\u201d Her expression faltered when she mentioned her family, but she recovered quickly. \u201c\u2026makes some good ones.\u201d\nYerin relaxed into the seat behind her. \u201cNot looking to dull my edge.\u201d\nThough Mercy did have one point. If they were going to rest, they might as well use the time productively. Yerin opened her void key and called a box to her. It floated over on a cloud; she hadn\u2019t Forged the cloud herself. This was just a fancy box.\nWith one thumb and an injection of her madra, she opened the lid. There was a shining ball within about the size of one of her knuckles. It shone like molten metal and swirled with scripted designs that resembled a pair of dragons intertwining with one another.\nThe Twin Dragon Rejuvenation Pill was half-refined and half-Forged, like the Heaven\u2019s Drop that had helped her advance to the limit of Truegold, but this one was several thousand times more expensive. It was made to help Archlords regenerate and improve the quality of their madra, pushing them closer to the top. For peak Archlords, it also helped synchronize their spirit and their bodies, which would bring them closer to Herald.\nIt wasn\u2019t so much of a leap for her, but she would benefit from both effects, and every step was something. Yerin popped it into her mouth\u2014it tasted like a burning peach\u2014and immediately began circulating its energies to the ends of her body.\nLittle Blue gave a curious whistle, and Yerin assumed she was asking about the pill. Until a second later, when the real meaning of the question penetrated her brain.\nMercy lit up. \u201cOh, that\u2019s perfect! I didn\u2019t want to be too nosy, but since Blue brought it up: how\u2019s it going with you and Lindon?\u201d\nYerin\u2019s back stiffened in the flexible seat Mercy had created for her. Relationship gossip. This was something friends her age were supposed to talk about, but Yerin didn\u2019t know how to do it.\nNot that this was the first time. Mercy asked these questions about as often as the sun rose\u2014or as often as the sun rose in the outside world, anyway.\nYerin still hadn\u2019t grown comfortable with it. She knew how to talk about fighting, not\u2026feelings.\n\u201cNot going at all, is it? He\u2019s out fighting.\u201d\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t been gone that long,\u201d Mercy said.\n\u201cEleven days.\u201d Lindon had turned the time difference down, but not so much this time. It was for the sake of training, but Yerin wished it hadn\u2019t given her so much time to sit and stew.\nMercy\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cReally? Has it been\u2026\u201d She peered suspiciously into her elixir. \u201cI need to spend more time in my own mind. Still, you\u2019ve got to have something to talk about.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be all bright and shiny, once I don\u2019t have to keep watching from the side.\u201d Yerin sighed. \u201cI\u2019m creeping closer, but it still feels like a crawl.\u201d\nMercy took another drink through her straw. \u201cI know it\u2019s hard waiting. I feel the same way, but I wish I had a Lindon.\u201d She gave a sigh to match Yerin\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m jealous of you.\u201d\nLittle Blue peered up into Mercy\u2019s face.\nMercy must have heard how her words sounded because she choked on her elixir and threw it aside. She raised both black-clad hands and waved them as though to stop Yerin\u2019s thoughts. \u201cWait!", "fdd77323-252c-4729-a251-659bfc4ad4d0": "Mercy\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cReally?

She raised both black-clad hands and waved them as though to stop Yerin\u2019s thoughts. \u201cWait! No! That\u2026That\u2019s not what I said. I wish I had a Lindon. Somebody like him in here, with me.\u201d\nBlue whistled a question.\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t say that!\u201d Mercy protested. \u201cThat was my moth\u2014Wait, how did you hear about that?\u201d\nYerin wondered what expression she was making. Mercy saw her face and turned bright red, but she reached out to grab Yerin\u2019s hands. \u201cStop! Listen. My mother put some weird thoughts into my head, but I\u2019m only saying you have a good thing. I\u2019m very happy for you. Both of you. And I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s not here.\u201d\nYerin\u2019s heart softened. She patted Mercy\u2019s hands back. \u201cThanks.\u201d And, before Mercy could also express surprise that Yerin had said \u2018thank you,\u2019 she pushed ahead. \u201cStarting to occur to me that I ought to ask you about your own feelings sometimes. Seems like you might have some interesting answers.\u201d\nMercy hunched down. \u201cOh, right. Is this how you feel when I put you on the spot? This feels bad!\u201d\n\u201cCuts both ways, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cYou should still ask me, though! We don\u2019t talk enough!\u201d\nLittle Blue sang out to remind them that she was still there.\nA few minutes later, Yerin returned to her room and settled in. She tried to steady her thoughts to rest. She was sure she wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep, but she had to take the advice she\u2019d given Orthos.\nShe had only lain there for a matter of minutes when she heard the alarm.\nShe was up and out of the building immediately, dashing for the control scripts. Her spiritual sense gave her all the information she needed, and the air throughout Ghostwind Hall boiled as some of the others sensed it too.\nYerin arrived in the control room to see golden light shining from all the projection constructs.\nLindon had left automatic defenses, but they wouldn\u2019t be enough. Reigan Shen had found them.\nAnd they weren\u2019t ready.", "4c6ba62a-6de5-40c0-bf52-d8fa0205d652": "12\n\n\n\n\n\nLindon emerged from the Trackless Sea to see Reigan Shen shredding a plague-spirit with a whip made of life madra.\nThe spirit fell apart, revealing the floating island it had been defending. Windfall drifted on dark blue clouds over the ocean, its crops blowing in the breeze.\nIts scripts were intact, including floating stones that bore new defensive scripts Lindon had left behind. Between the plague-spirit and this new layer of scripts, the island could stall even a Monarch for a while.\nIt had done so, but Windfall\u2019s primary defense was always supposed to be its veils. Reigan Shen had found them somehow.\nDespite the Weeping Dragon storm filling the northern sky, the Monarch was willing to fight.\nAnd Lindon was exhausted.\nYerin hovered in front of the cloud fortress. She deflected a blast of Shen\u2019s into the sky and retaliated with a Striker slash.\nLindon shouted wordlessly and poured madra into a stream of dragon\u2019s breath.\nIt was swallowed by one portal as another opened. A hand of blue-gold lightning extended and released a river of storm madra at Yerin.\nShe braced herself behind her sword and pushed against Tiberian Arelius\u2019 attack. Her spirit was at its peak, stronger than Lindon had ever felt it, her will iron. Even so, she was being forced back.\nReigan Shen appeared behind her. \u201cActivate,\u201d he commanded.\nYerin pitted herself against him, and for an instant, she resisted both Monarch techniques. But only for an instant.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Lindon shouted, pushing his willpower against Shen\u2019s.\nHe was too weak.\nYerin disappeared in a flash of white light as her Moonlight Bridge, which Reigan Shen had helped create, activated at his command. She reappeared inside the doorway containing the portal to Ghostwind Hall and was sucked into it.\nTime moved so much faster inside that she was attempting to emerge again only an instant later, but Tiberian\u2019s lightning blasted through it.\nA quarter of the house vanished. If not for the reinforced scripts, the whole island would have disintegrated.\nLindon felt the portal collapse, and his hopes died with it.\n[They\u2019re not dead!] Dross desperately shouted. [It\u2019s just the entrance! They\u2019re still in there!]\nLindon knew. But now they would be helpless to escape until he released them, unless they found a way to open it from the inside.\nAnd he had no time left.\nOutside the cloud fortress, bolts of living blue-gold lightning sizzled as they fell to the sea. The sky was dark, the waves tossed in the wind, and the Weeping Dragon looked down on him from the clouds.\nMuch closer, Reigan Shen stared at him with no sympathy. He pointed a shining dagger in Lindon\u2019s direction but didn\u2019t attack. Instead, he slashed open a portal in midair that opened onto a palace of white and gold.\n\u201cClose!\u201d Lindon commanded.\nShen dispersed the working without a word. If Lindon had any remaining strength at all, the lion would have been hopelessly trapped, but instead he stopped halfway into the portal and spoke.\n\u201cIf you see Ozmanthus on the other side,\u201d Shen said, \u201ctell him I didn\u2019t kill you.\u201d\nHe would have if he could, Lindon knew. Lindon\u2019s heart boiled with hatred, and his arm twitched, but he was torn up from the inside. His mouth tasted copper, and he glared at Shen with the intensity of the Void and Dragon Icons combined.\nLindon choked out words past bloody teeth. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026not coming\u2026for you. I am.\u201d\n\u201cCan you?\u201d Shen asked.\nThe portal winked closed, and Lindon lowered himself to Windfall\u2019s island as rain began to fall.\nThe Weeping Dragon was here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nTiberian\u2019s lightning thundered through the portal into the pocket world, and it blasted Yerin back inside. Though it scorched her body and spirit, she forced her will against it to hold back the tide.\nShe stopped the bulk of the Striker technique, but strands of lightning flickered off to the side, tearing trenches from the stone of the central island. Worse, the power was pushing against the barriers of the pocket world.\nNo\u2026the worst part was that Lindon was still outside.\nGreen runes appeared behind her, and she was relieved to feel Ziel\u2019s madra intercepting the stray bolts. Yerin refocused, ready to dive through again.\nBefore she could, the portal crumbled. It tore to pieces like a house of sand blowing away in the wind.\nYerin\u2019s soul shook as she watched the spot where the portal had been.

On the inside, she screamed, but her body didn\u2019t get the message.\nShe had felt what was happening outside. Their constructs were cut off now, but she knew what condition Lindon was in. He was on his last legs, and now he was facing down Reigan Shen and the Weeping Dragon. Alone.\nOnly seconds passed. Every breath into Yerin\u2019s lungs stretched like it took a full minute.\nHer fear became panic and advanced beyond that, stretching into a rejection of reality. She had not worked so long and fought so hard to die here.\nThe world seemed to hum around her, like it had when she was trying to sense the Sword Icon. She heard a distant music, faint and ethereal, but it echoed through her bones. She realized distantly that she had summoned the Phoenix Song, which allowed her to hear the sounds more clearly.\nThe music was a complex melody that combined what she remembered of the Sword Icon, the razor-edged silence of Eithan\u2019s deadly techniques, and the sounds of bloodlust from the Phoenix Song. She knew what that song meant.\nIt was leading her to the ones she was about to kill.\nYerin didn\u2019t know who she blamed for this situation. Reigan Shen, the Dreadgods, all the Monarchs, maybe Fate itself. She forgot the distance between herself and her target. Whoever or whatever it was, she was going to cut them.\nHer sword was in her hand, and there was a ragged network of cracks in the pocket world where the portal had collapsed. To her, it was like a keyhole, and she stabbed her sword inside like a key.\nIt didn\u2019t penetrate deeply enough, but she focused her will like she never had before. The sword sank until it pierced something deeper than reality.\nA familiar hand grabbed her by the shoulder and tried to pull her back, but Ziel might as well have tried to pull down the moon. She turned to glance at him over her shoulder, but only because it didn\u2019t cost her any time. She was still cutting her way out.\nWhatever Ziel saw in her, it caused him to shudder. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to lead where it came in,\u201d he said urgently. \u201cYou\u2019re casting yourself into the Way. You could end up in an entirely different world.\u201d\nShe still heard the distant song. \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt takes skill to navigate. Do you know how?\u201d\n\u201cLearned to swim by falling out of boats.\u201d She finished her cut and opened a ragged hole into endless blue. The power shook her and tore at her, but she still heard the song. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you one place it won\u2019t take me: here.\u201d\nZiel made a frustrated sound, but before Yerin leaped into the gap, he hurled silver runes around her. If they were intended to stop her, she fully meant to break them, but they only formed a protective bubble.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see you soon,\u201d Ziel assured her, but he didn\u2019t follow her in.\nThen the irresistible currents seized Yerin and tossed her into the flows of order. She felt herself crushed, battered, and buffeted by force she could scarcely imagine. Her spiritual senses were blinded; this was beyond madra, beyond aura. It felt like she was inside the pillar that held up reality itself.\nShe still heard the song, like a declaration of war. And she willed herself toward it.\nYerin caught glimpses of the real world flashing by, but they were too fast to be comprehended, even at her level. She could only get impressions of strong emotions or presences, and she focused on the ones she was looking for.\nReigan Shen and the Weeping Dragon. Those were her targets.\nShe felt it approaching. Her song grew louder, almost deafening. And she willed herself out, into the stream that twisted closer to what was real.\n\u2026she didn\u2019t stop.

Yerin struggled against the force of the Way, trying to claw her way back, but she may as well not have bothered.\nAlmost immediately, she felt something else. Another impression of Reigan Shen and the Weeping Dragon, but smaller. More distant.\nShe couldn\u2019t afford to miss this one. Who knew if there would be another chance, or when it would come?\nThis time, she activated her Moonlight Bridge and urged it in that direction.\nShe thought it would be hard to activate the Divine Treasure here, but instead it was like trying to strike a spark when the air was full of fire aura. Instead of a simple white light, she exploded into a pale moon, one that swallowed up the blue.\nAnd when she reappeared, she was standing on a ruined building and looking out onto a war.\nThe song drifted all around her as yellow-haired sacred artists wearing dark blue did battle with their opposites. Massive script formations lit the battlefield as lights from many Paths clashed against one another. The opposing force carried banners of gold and had legions of cloudships that outnumbered their enemies.\nBut Yerin didn\u2019t particularly care who they were. They weren\u2019t Reigan Shen, and they weren\u2019t the Weeping Dragon.\nShe tapped into the Moonlight Bridge again. Take me to Lindon, she urged it.\nThe Treasure was quiet. Expended. It had nothing left.\nYerin let out a sound like she was being stabbed through the gut. Her spirit and thoughts were in chaos, and her veins bubbled with murderous hatred.\nIt was all but impossible to use techniques in this kind of mindset, but the Phoenix Song was closer than ever. The mysterious melody was louder and more insistent, reminding her that she was surrounded by enemies.\nOnly then did she look up and pay attention to the symbol on the golden banners.\nA white lion.\nThis was House Shen.\nThey were flanked by a broad storm cloud, pouring rain and flickering with lightning. A collection of buildings sat on top of the cloud, like an entire sect built in the sky. Its sacred artists hurled serpents of living lightning.\nStormcallers, the cultists of the Weeping Dragon. Yerin had expected them to follow their master through the Trackless Sea, but it seemed they had found easier prey here.\nA Herald led the combined forces from the front, a woman with shining wings made of lightning and a thin, delicate sword that crackled with power. Yushi, the Thunder Fairy. Reigan Shen\u2019s right hand.\nShe had long, brown hair, and was as delicate as her nickname suggested. If Yerin couldn\u2019t feel her strength as a Herald, she would say Yushi looked too delicate to hold a weapon. The wings didn\u2019t seem to be her Goldsign, as a spark burned on the center of Yushi\u2019s forehead.\nThere were others on the battlefield with real power\u2014two Sages and a handful of Archlords\u2014but Yerin was already moving.\nA script-formation flared to life, blocking her. It was made of yellow runes, and she could feel that this was a powerful boundary operated by dozens of Lords and Ladies.\nA pair of claws Forged of sword and blood madra appeared to her left and right. Netherclaw\u2019s binding. At the same time, she Enforced her sword and struck with all her might.\nThe formation rang like thunder, but it didn\u2019t break. The symbols turned orange. Some of the Underlords maintaining the boundary collapsed.\nShe hit it again. The runes turned red.\nThe third time, she broke through, but an Archlord was aiming a launcher construct at her. It was constructed of fine materials and reminded her of Lindon\u2019s cannon.\nAs he activated the weapon, she struck the aura of her sword, and it rang like a bell.\nBlades of aura erupted from within him, tearing him apart from the inside out.

Blue serpents of storm madra encircled his upper arms. The Sage of Calling Storms.\nHis smile and eyes were too wide, like he was doing his best impression of a skull. Somewhere below her conscious thoughts, Yerin wondered if you had to look like a monster if you wanted to lead a Dreadgod cult.\n\u201cHave you come on behalf of your master?\u201d the Storm Sage asked eagerly.\nYerin stopped. Her skin still shone with the red moonlight of the Phoenix Song, and she heard the subtle music that prompted her to kill, but she had another mission.\n\u201cSend me to Lindon,\u201d she demanded of the Sage.\nYushi put a hand on her hip. \u201cDidn\u2019t you get a teleportation Treasure?\u201d\nYerin didn\u2019t spare her a single thought.\nThe Sage spread his arms wide. \u201cI cannot bid farewell before I\u2019m graced by divine teachings!

She sounded panicked, but her words didn\u2019t penetrate his haze at first.\nHow were they going to do this? He hadn\u2019t completed his Sage insight yet. Though his studies of the Paths of Heaven had helped him understand quite a bit more about Sage authority and the mechanics behind the world, theoretical and practical knowledge were leagues apart.\nIt was hard to put those ideas into practice here, and he needed to practice them in order to get out. Fortunately, he had a little time.\nMercy\u2019s shaking finally got through to him. \u201cWhere\u2019s Yerin?\u201d she demanded. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\n\u201cThe portal\u2019s destroyed.\u201d That was probably obvious, but it was best to go over every detail. \u201cLindon\u2019s weak. Maybe dead. Yerin went after him.\u201d\nHe expected Mercy to panic, but after only an instant of shock across her face, it was like her face had turned to steel. In that moment, she resembled what Ziel had seen of her mother.\n\u201cAre they still outside?\u201d Mercy asked calmly.\n\u201cLindon is.

This was about to be another case of a young person doing something reckless. \u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d\n\u201cMy mother left some of her authority in my Book. I\u2019m going to advance, then I\u2019m going to borrow her power to transport us.\u201d\nShe was already sitting down in the cycling position, and her tone made that ridiculous statement sound almost reasonable.\nZiel didn\u2019t have a better idea. Leaving Orthos and Little Blue here seemed like a terrible idea, but he couldn\u2019t make a script strong enough to shelter them in the Way. He would at least have to explain things to them.\nThat was a job better suited to Mercy, but she had already closed her eyes and sunk her spirit into her Book.\nWhich left Ziel standing before her lifeless body and her shining Book, functionally alone, wrestling with the task of visiting Orthos and Little Blue.\nThere were other things he could do. His understanding of the Way and the runes used to control it was shallow at best, so preparation time was critical.\nBut he sighed and began trudging toward the other two spirits who remained on the island. No sense in putting it off.\nInside the Blackflame cycling chamber, Orthos was devouring another dragon-spirit. This one was an Archlord with enough power that even Ziel felt a little pressure. Orthos wasn\u2019t having an easy time of it; the spirit was missing several mouthfuls of its flesh, lost to the hunger fangs around the turtle\u2019s jaws, but the clash between the two of them still crashed violently against the invisible barrier of script that sealed off this room.\nZiel had laid this script himself, and from the outside, he was wondering if he should reinforce it. He reassured himself that at least Little Blue was safe, but she wasn\u2019t supporting Orthos, as he had expected.\nShe was sitting in a cycling position at the center of the script as the Blackflame battle raged around her. A tiny bubble of blue-white energy surrounded her, and as any madra scraped that sphere of safety, the foreign energy was wiped away.\nAfter only a second or two, Ziel noticed that both combatants were avoiding the small Hollow Domain. Either the Remnant sensed what would happen to it or it had already been taught a lesson by the Riverseed.\nThe script that contained them dampened spiritual perception. It was hard for him to sense inside, like trying to listen in on a padded room, but it was almost impossible for them to sense out. Even so, only a breath or two after Ziel arrived, Little Blue\u2019s eyes snapped open and met his.\nZiel recoiled. Her gaze was uncharacteristically intense. It was so much like Lindon\u2019s that it was unnerving, as though Lindon and his contracted spirit had switched bodies.\nThen Blue waved cheerily and let her bubble drop. She ran to him, each of her little footsteps chiming against the floor. Orthos grabbed the dragon-Remnant in his jaws and body-slammed it into the ground on the other side, freeing up space for Blue to move.", "324052b7-3477-4a27-aada-013f3eb5b7bc": "Either the Remnant sensed what would happen to it or it had already been taught a lesson by the Riverseed.\nThe script that contained them dampened spiritual perception.

She ran to him, each of her little footsteps chiming against the floor. Orthos grabbed the dragon-Remnant in his jaws and body-slammed it into the ground on the other side, freeing up space for Blue to move.\nThe impact of the Remnant shook the stone so much that Little Blue was lifted an inch off the ground, but she hardly seemed to notice.\nShe shivered when she crossed over the script, but when she was out, she asked him a tinkling question.\nZiel looked down to meet her eyes seriously. \u201cLindon\u2019s in danger. The portal is destroyed. Yerin already went after him, and Mercy and I are going too. Is there anything you can tell us?\u201d\nLittle Blue\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t widen, and he didn\u2019t sense any fear from her. She scrunched up her eyebrows and held her chin in a hand, considering.\nA moment later, she gave him a response like the ringing of miniature bells. Ziel interpreted them as saying that Lindon wasn\u2019t afraid, so she wasn\u2019t either.\nShe ran up to pat him on the knee, wished him good luck, and then hurried back inside the script to continue training.\nZiel watched her leave, and for a moment wished he had a contracted spirit or sacred beast of his own. The emotional support alone might have helped him through the worst years of his life.\nThen again, Lindon had far too many tiny companions. Ziel tried to picture himself with half a dozen pets and shuddered. He couldn\u2019t imagine it. The heavens had only made him responsible for one life, and that was already a heavy burden to bear.\nZiel returned to the portal and began operating the Grand Oath Array. Profound silver runes spun around him. Controlling the complex will, authority, and scripted interactions took his full concentration.\nHe still wasn\u2019t sure what difference he and Mercy could make, even if they did make it to Lindon\u2019s side in time. But he knew one thing: if Lindon died, he wouldn\u2019t do so alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nLittle Blue watched the battle between Orthos and the black dragon Remnant as it crashed against the ceiling.\nOrthos tore another strip from the Remnant, but he took a tail-slap on the shell that sent him slamming back down to the cave floor. The impact once again launched Blue into the air, but she hardly noticed. She was focused on Orthos\u2019 feelings.\nEvery new mouthful of madra added to the struggle inside of him. That was the real battle, not out here.\nOrthos was wrestling against the mind and spirit of another while trying not to lose himself. It was a furious fight, and Little Blue wished him constant encouragement while she waited for him to win.\nThe battles on the outside and the inside ended at roughly the same time, as Orthos finished digesting the Remnant\u2019s tail. With that, he was too powerful, and the spirit had taken too much damage. It sunk down and quietly dissolved into essence as Orthos roared his victory.\nThen Blue ran up and laid her hand on his skin.\nHe grunted in discomfort as her madra flooded through his channels, cooling them as it passed. He didn\u2019t like it when she cleansed him so suddenly, but they didn\u2019t have time to waste.\n\u201cHe\u2019s grown stronger,\u201d Orthos said, and the rumble of his voice shook Blue\u2019s entire body. \u201cBut he\u2019s on the verge of death.\u201d\nShe cheeped in agreement. Blue told him what Ziel had said, and Orthos grunted. \u201cYou should go. You could help.\u201d\nShe shook her head rapidly. She might be able to help the others, but she wasn\u2019t strong enough to help Lindon yet. She needed more for that.\nAnd without her here, Orthos would never make it in time.\nHe sensed that thought, and he didn\u2019t like it. It pricked his pride, though he didn\u2019t acknowledge that, so she didn\u2019t mention it either.\nInstead, she caught his eye and pointed out that it was her turn.", "89ab08b3-d0fe-43b7-b96e-a43cdfd20d73": "He didn\u2019t like it when she cleansed him so suddenly, but they didn\u2019t have time to waste.\n\u201cHe\u2019s grown stronger,\u201d Orthos said, and the rumble of his voice shook Blue\u2019s entire body. \u201cBut he\u2019s on the verge of death.\u201d\nShe cheeped in agreement.

It pricked his pride, though he didn\u2019t acknowledge that, so she didn\u2019t mention it either.\nInstead, she caught his eye and pointed out that it was her turn.\nWithout comment, Orthos began walking into another chamber, and she hopped up onto his head for a ride.\nThe next cave inside the island held a device Lindon had assembled from stolen Monarch ingredients specifically for her.\nSix terrifyingly powerful Remnants were sealed in scripted tanks around the edges of the cave, each about the same distance from one another. They were all either the equivalent of Heralds, and thus appeared more lifelike than most spirits, or they had unique authority and powerful will.\nLines of script connected them to a circle in the center. It shone with a column of liquid blue-white power.\nPure madra.\nThis whole device was for madra purification, and it was meant for Little Blue. It was the last step to prepare her to advance to Herald.\nAfter that, it would be down to Lindon to push her the rest of the way.\nShe opened Lindon\u2019s void key, which was stored nearby, and took out some of the Archlord natural treasures. There weren\u2019t many left. She let the quicksilver fire bathe her, which was only a sort of warm, shivery feeling at this point. Nothing like the dramatic transformation she\u2019d felt the first time.\nBut she wanted to be as stable as possible when she went in.\n\u201cYou should wait,\u201d Orthos advised her. \u201cIf I don\u2019t cycle this power now, it will leave my control and injure me. If you enter now, I won\u2019t be able to help you.\u201d\nShe gave him a laugh. How could he help her anyway? Maybe if Lindon were here, he could save her if something went wrong, but there was too much power involved in this transformation for Orthos to handle.\nOrthos snorted smoke. \u201cYou don\u2019t really want to do this alone, do you?\u201d\nShe hesitated. He wasn\u2019t wrong. Even if he couldn\u2019t help, it would be an encouragement for her to have someone with her.\nBut she firmed her resolve. This was a test of her will. To see if she could make it to the next level.\nA voice echoed out from elsewhere on the island. \u201cAlone?\u201d Noroloth\u2019s Remnant flew closer, peeking his overly large head into the cavern entrance. \u201cIt sounds like you could use the assistance of a powerful dragon.\u201d\nHe hesitated before adding, \u201cYou will tell your master that I helped, won\u2019t you?\u201d\nOrthos glared at him.\nBlue gave him a reassuring pat on the foot, let out a chime of confidence, and strode into the column of blue-white light. Soon, all this power would be hers.\nInstantly, she was buried in the conflicting wills of six Remnants, all more powerful than her. They were weakened by the scripts and devices, otherwise their wills would crush her directly, but together their attention was heavy.\nNoroloth lightened the weight more, but not too much. The pressure was the point.\nThe bound Remnants screamed at her, and Blue screamed back. Not in fear. She matched them for intensity.\nThey should hurry up and give her their power.\nShe had somewhere to be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nThe sixth page of the Book of Eternal Night wasn\u2019t as large as the nightmare labyrinth buried in the fifth page.

The technique on the sixth page of the Book of Eternal Night, and a technique that Malice had only learned to imitate when she became a Sage. For one step, Mercy borrowed the intangibility of shadow and slipped through space itself, reappearing nearby.\nThe Herald had plenty of combat experience, and this battle would be a long one, but the first strike was hers. Mercy released her arrow, which flew like a falling star.\nGarrylondryth swept his tail at the arrow, carrying his mighty will, but the arrow had the Shadestep technique applied to it as well. It ceased to exist for just an instant, then rematerialized and continued its path uninterrupted.\nThe missile crashed into green scales and the dragon roared in pain.\nMercy held onto the vision longer, absorbing herself into the feeling of controlling an Archlady\u2019s spirit. Her sense of purpose was strong and comforting, like a warm blanket of reassurance. She was confident in what she wanted and who she was.\nAnd in the family behind her.\nShe could only hold the vision so long before it faded, and the memory of her faith in the Akura clan stabbed her in the gut. It was the trust Malice wanted her to have. So did Mercy herself. She would love to trust her family that much.\nBut she didn\u2019t.\nShe meditated on everything she had learned in the vision for a moment. How it felt to control so much madra so effortlessly, and the advantages of a body thrice reforged in soulfire.\nThen she faced a second mirror.\nIn this one, she was only a few years older than her current self. She found herself in an arena that reminded her of the Uncrowned King tournament, and she faced down an Archlord on a sword Path.\nShe danced around him. Her armor was more solid than it had ever been, her arrows stronger, and she could feel a mysterious authority working through her with every shot she took with her bow. The Bow Icon, which slowly grew closer as she fought.\nIn the back of her mind, Mercy felt herself grow through the battle, and she tried to get a sense of her Archlord revelation.\nThe mind she had in this dream reality rejected the idea. Forcing advancement? It was a foolish road.\nTime and experience would give her the self-insight she needed to determine her future. The Archlord revelation was as much about choosing the path she would walk for the rest of her life as it was identifying the path she was on. If she rushed her decision, she would regret it. At worst, a poorly chosen revelation might even cap her future potential.\nWhen the vision ended, Mercy felt her other self\u2019s disapproval recede. There were six visions here. Six different versions of herself, all fighting for her family in different ways and with subtly different abilities.

Her family would be best served if she steadied her advancement.\nMercy sat in the center of the mirrors and chewed on the visions. The world began to shake around her; the page was rejecting her. She had stayed long enough, and the Book wanted her to leave and consolidate what she learned.\nShe pitted her will against the Book of Eternal Night and remained exactly where she was.\nI am not Malice, she thought. I am Mercy. Her Overlord revelation.\nWhere did she go from there? What would it look like in the future for her to be herself?\nThe trembling of the Book didn\u2019t get softer. It intensified by the second until she couldn\u2019t hold it anymore. When her consciousness was kicked out of the sixth page, back to the pocket world, she found herself sitting in a cycling position on bare stone.\nZiel sat across from her, eyes closed, meditating among the fading spatial cracks where the portal had once stood. Silver runes and green ones spun around him in intricate loops.\nWhen she saw him, she was ashamed. She had said she was going to advance and borrow her mother\u2019s power as though it were simple, as though she could do whatever she wished. She\u2019d talked like she was Yerin, or Lindon, who could just push their way through advancement realms with sheer stubbornness.\nMercy couldn\u2019t break the rules after all. She didn\u2019t have what it took.\nShe opened her mouth to tell Ziel that, but he spoke first.\n\u201cThe heavens don\u2019t decide when you advance to Archlord,\u201d he said, without opening his eyes. \u201cYou do.\u201d\nHe slid something across the rocky ground between them. A void key.\n\u201cI\u2019m almost out of Archlord treasures,\u201d he continued. \u201cPut them to use.\u201d\nShe swept her perception through the void key and found six Archlord-level natural treasures remaining. Some of them weren\u2019t at full power, but she could make a balanced circle out of them. They might be enough to advance.\nBut she would have only one chance.\nWith reluctance, she set the void key back down. \u201cI don\u2019t have the insight yet, I\u2019m sorry. I can still open the seventh page for a second, though, so I should be able to send you\u2014\u201d\nEven with his eyes closed, he somehow glared at her. \u201cDo I look like I have the time to spare for a conversation? Your Archlord revelation is the oath to which you dedicate your future. Anything works, as long as you are dedicated to it, honestly and fully. That honesty is the hard part. Now don\u2019t bother me until you advance.\u201d\nMercy really wanted to keep asking him questions, even though she\u2019d spoken to him about the advancement many times over the weeks they\u2019d shared this pocket world together.\nShe didn\u2019t think his attitude was fair. \u201cDon\u2019t think too hard, it\u2019s only the entire purpose for the rest of your life.\u201d\nMercy scowled at Ziel. Then she scowled at the entire pocket world and scowled at herself for scowling.\nWhat was a purpose she could accept?\nShe could swear herself to her friends, but that felt like it was about someone else, not herself.

Not only would their battle be likely to break Windfall, opening Ghostwind Hall and endangering everyone inside, but Lindon needed the support of the labyrinth.

Just like him, the Weeping Dragon had been empowered by the death of the Silent King.\nAs liquid lightning rained from the sky and sizzled against the ground, Lindon sensed the thing he feared the most.\nMercy and Ziel tumbled out of a rip in space.\nThey spilled out only a few yards from where Lindon stood, just north of Sacred Valley. Ziel braced himself on his hammer, and the energy from the Weeping Dragon was reduced to sparks when it hit the silver runes that spun all around him.\nMercy called her armor to protect her from the rain, but she raised her arms triumphantly as they appeared. \u201cYou did it!\u201d she cried to Ziel.\nZiel looked to Lindon, and relief was clear on his face. \u201cLooks like we weren\u2019t too late.\u201d Then fear and despair shivered through him as he looked up and saw the Weeping Dragon in the distance.\nMercy, too, gasped as she looked upward. She shivered and hugged her sides tightly.\nLindon controlled his expression. He didn\u2019t want to frighten them, because they weren\u2019t too late.\nHe was.\nMercy had advanced to Archlord, which at any other time would be cause for celebration.

The will of a primeval monster began to crash against the protections around Sacred Valley.\nThe Weeping Dragon\u2019s assault on the invisible wall generated by the script sounded louder than its thunder.\n\u201cWe should get behind the script,\u201d Lindon said.\nZiel gave Lindon a doubtful look. \u201cYou drove off the Monarchs, and now\u2019s your time for a final stand? Come with us.\u201d\nThe Weeping Dragon wouldn\u2019t let Lindon leave. Even if it did, it would follow him until he was cornered.\n\u201cAs long as I\u2019m here, I have another card to play.\u201d Once they passed the border, Lindon focused his attention on the two of them. \u201cThank you for coming, and good-bye. Move.\u201d\nZiel and Mercy both resisted, and for a second, he couldn\u2019t move them. Their spirits shone with power and resolve.\nUntil Lindon leaned on them with the full strength of his will.\nThen they vanished.\nHe transferred them to a distant branch of the labyrinth on the Rosegold continent. They could help there; he had sensed a distant clash between House Shen and the Arelius family, as well as a power that might have been Yerin. He hoped. Someone with similar powers was calling his name, at least.\nMaybe they could win somewhere else while he tried to survive.\n[I don\u2019t like it when you cut me off like that,] Dross complained. [How will other people hear how clever I am?]\n\u201cHow much time left until the bindings are ready?\u201d Lindon asked.\nDross shrugged. [They\u2019re ready now. The more time we give them, the better.]\nFar below Lindon, pieces of the Slumbering Wraith were burning away. They dissolved, flesh and madra as one, converting into energy to fuel ancient scripts and hunger bindings. This was the same technique he\u2019d leaned on earlier\u2014the hunger echoes\u2014but far, far larger in scope. Enough that it took a hundred bindings and miles of scripts to support.\nIf Lindon had to provide power for this himself, it would empty his pure core and his hunger arm ten times over. He\u2019d told Dross to move the labyrinth, to gradually feed the bindings with pieces of Subject One\u2019s body.\nThe more fuel they gave this echo, the more power it would have.\n\u201cThen how much time do we have before we have to drop the barrier?\u201d Lindon asked.\n[I\u2019ll give you a countdown when we\u2019re ten seconds out. Which is right now. Ten\u2026nine\u2026]\nLindon braced himself. He steadied his mind and sharpened his will. Suriel\u2019s marble rolled between the fingertips of his left hand. He had inherited the labyrinth from the Abidan, from Eithan, from his ancestors in Sacred Valley. Now, he had the chance to pay them back.\n[\u2026three\u2026two\u2026]\n\u201cRise,\u201d Lindon commanded.\nA hundred echo bindings activated at once.\nThe labyrinth remembered everyone its hunger aura had ever fed on.

Skin like dark stone, and a lashing tail that could slice through mountains.\nAs the protective script around Sacred Valley fell, a ghost of the Wandering Titan rose.\nThe Weeping Dragon\u2019s head jerked back in an exaggerated expression of surprise, and\u2014to Lindon\u2019s own shock\u2014the wind aura echoed for miles with a voice like thunder.\n\u201cWhat have you done to my brother?\u201d the Weeping Dragon asked, and it was as though the sky itself spoke.\nThe Wandering Titan roared in its face and punched the Dragon in the jaw.\nWhen the Weeping Dragon reeled back from the blow, the Titan leaped over the mountain to the north and kept after it. Serpents of liquid lightning streamed down from the storm clouds, but the stone warrior\u2019s tail was a lashing blur that reduced them to shining clouds of essence.\nThe Titan linked hands around the Dragon\u2019s neck and dragged it down, roaring as it slammed its brother to earth.\nQuaking ground shook Lindon, and though it was not enough to harm him anymore, it wasn\u2019t comfortable. Dross summoned a cloud and slipped it underneath him, so Lindon sank into its soft surface.\n[That\u2019s all you had left,] Dross said anxiously. [You\u2019re out. Don\u2019t go trying to spend more than you have, okay?]\nLindon tried to respond, but even thinking was too much for him. He sank into the softness of the cloud and drifted off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nZiel appeared over some ruins surrounded by a blackened forest that looked like it had been the victim of a recent wildfire.\nIt was still more intact than the land outside Sacred Valley.\nMercy\u2019s scream of protest was still in the air when she reappeared, but it tapered off as she realized Lindon had banished them. Her shoulders slumped, and she looked on the verge of tears.\n\u201cWe can help,\u201d she said, and Ziel was sure she was still talking to the long-distant Lindon.\nZiel fixed his spiritual sense on the distance. There was likely a reason Lindon had sent them here, and he could feel a great battle in that direction.\n\u201cWe still can,\u201d Ziel said. He began Forging runes in a circle around himself.\nWhether Lindon intended them to be here or not, they could at least see what was happening over there.\nMercy swiped at her eyes angrily, but she looked in the same direction Ziel indicated. She stepped closer to him to share the script-circle, but both their spirits shook as they felt something at the same time.\nAn angry flare of blood and sword madra, all blended together with an aspect of hunger. He knew Mercy would recognize it just as he did.\nNeither of them needed to say Yerin\u2019s name, but Ziel wondered how Lindon had transported them so close. He\u2019d suggested he didn\u2019t know where Yerin was, but now he was sending them within a day\u2019s travel of Yerin.\nMaybe it was a function of the labyrinth, or maybe it was an ability Lindon had gained when he merged with a Dreadgod. Who knew what kind of senses he had access to now?\n\u201cCan you protect yourself?\u201d Ziel asked. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to go fast.\u201d\nHe could expand his own protection to cover them both, but doing so would mean power he wasn\u2019t spending on acceleration. They needed to cover a day\u2019s worth of flight on a cloudship as soon as possible, which meant they needed lots of force.\nMercy covered herself completely in armor. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nThat was all the discussion Ziel needed.\nThe Path of the Dawn Oath surrounded them in script, manipulating force aura and lifting them into the sky.

As any force artist knew, it was easier to maintain momentum than to create it.\nBut before he activated the script to send them hurtling forward, he hesitated and sent his awareness out to the silver runes floating around him. His control of the Grand Oath Array had grown day by day until he was quite comfortable with it now, and it should help here.\nThough if he made a mistake, he might send them hurtling into the earth fast enough to annihilate both their bodies in one strike.\nHe should get Mercy\u2019s opinion on this. He didn\u2019t want to risk her unfairly. \u201cI have something that could get us there faster, but it might be a little\u2026\u201d\n\u2018Risky\u2019 didn\u2019t seem quite enough, but before he could find the right word, Mercy flicked him between the horns with her armored finger.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\nThat hurt, but Ziel didn\u2019t say anything. He controlled the Array, feeling the authority of the Rune Queen pass over him and alter something fundamental to reality.\nWith manipulations of her ancient script, he changed his and Mercy\u2019s relationship to time. The world seemed to slow down as they sped up, though curiously the silver runes seemed to orbit at the same rate.\nOnly then did he activate the green force scripts. It launched them forward, then the second one caught them and hurled them faster, then the third\u2026\nEven with the force scripts that surrounded Ziel, keeping him together, flying in this way felt like drilling through stone with his face. Wind around them exploded as they moved faster and faster, and a quick glance behind showed that they were kicking up hurricanes in their wake.\nHe hurriedly adjusted their path upward so they wouldn\u2019t destroy anyone by accident just from the wake of their passage. Every few seconds, before they could slow down, he Forged another script-circle.\nZiel found himself fortunate that his Oathsign technique was so madra-efficient, since most of the power came from the aura the scripts manipulated rather than from the Forged runes themselves. Otherwise, his spirit would have drained itself dry in moments.\nIt seemed he would arrive in good enough shape to fight. Especially since they were looking to arrive sooner than he expected.\nMercy was trying to shout something, though Ziel couldn\u2019t hear it. The distant battlefield rapidly approached, the presences becoming clearer and clearer.\nAs he grew close, he could feel who was fighting.\nHe almost lost control of his technique.\nThen he launched himself even faster.\nMercy was grabbing him with her amethyst gauntlets and shaking him\u2014though not too much, lest she send him outside the script and drop him to the land below. He was paying her no attention, nor did he sense Yerin, even when she was close enough to shine like a crimson star right in front of him.\nHis perception was locked entirely onto one lone figure. A familiar presence whose power crackled with the hungry lightning of the Weeping Dragon.\nThe Sage of Calling Storms.\nEvery channel in Ziel\u2019s body flinched in remembered pain. He could see the Sage torturing and slaughtering his people one at a time, leaving Ziel\u2014his defeated foe\u2014there as a witness. Keeping him alive as a twisted trophy.\nZiel filled himself with the Stone Anchor, force madra holding him together, and pulled his shield from his soulspace. That and his hammer flowed with madra. Maybe too much madra; at this rate, he would be out of power in minutes.\nBut one way or another, his fight with the Storm Sage wouldn\u2019t be a long one.\nMercy shouted at him again, but he was beyond hearing her. The Sage was in his sight now, turning his direction with arms wide and welcoming. A Forged dragon appeared over his head, aiming at Ziel, but Yerin tore it apart before her attention was recaptured by Yushi, the Thunder Fairy.\nZiel hurtled at the Sage like a thrown spear.

By the time the Sage tried to open space, Ziel had already operated the Array.\nFor just an instant, Calling Storms was locked in time. He broke the working a second later.\nThen Ziel hit him like a meteor.\nThe face of his shield crashed into the entire front side of the Sage\u2019s body with a crunching of bones. Even with the empowerment of Ziel\u2019s Enforcer technique, his own arm cracked.\nHe felt nothing.\nZiel was moving much too fast to stop. He and the Sage hurtled together into the side of a cliff, which they destroyed with their impact. They tore a trench through the landscape for what felt like a mile before they ground to a halt.\nZiel let his shield fall from a broken arm, raising his hammer in the other. The Sage stirred, his figure covered in blood and dirt.\nZiel\u2019s hammer crashed down on him.\nThe earth exploded again.\nLightning erupted from beneath Ziel\u2019s feet, throwing him back. Sages were no tougher than any other Archlords\u2014that is to say, they were made of wood next to the steel of Heralds\u2014but that was no secret. Every Sage had their own way of compensating for that vulnerability.\nCalling Storms, it seemed, had invested in regeneration.\nHis body reconstructed itself from mush, starting with his manic grin. \u201cI knew\u2014\u201d the Sage began, but Ziel had activated the Array again.\nHis hammer was propelled by three force scripts and accelerated in time. It crushed the Striker technique the Sage sent out on reflex and continued to crash into the left side of the man\u2019s body.\nHe would have flown into the distance, but instead he ran into a bubble of manipulated time. He was stuck like a fly in syrup, and Ziel only released the grip of the Array when he had readied another blow of the hammer, this time coming down on Calling Storms with the weight of the heavens.\nThe Storm Sage\u2019s whole body exploded, but that still wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy Ziel. He scanned hungrily for the man\u2019s Remnant.\nUntil he realized the pieces of the Sage\u2019s body were pulling themselves together. It was a powerful working of blood madra and aura, and the small analytical part of Ziel\u2019s brain that still functioned recognized that this was probably a Divine Treasure gifted to the man by the Sage of Red Faith.\nZiel used the time to Forge more scripts to enhance himself.\nHe had waited years for this. How many times had he wished this man had killed him? How many nights had he been unable to sleep, thanks to the unnatural knots the Sage had tied in his spirit?\nAs soon as his body was capable of it, the Sage of Calling Storms started laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s you, it\u2019s you, it\u2019s you! I knew I would see you again, I just knew it! What was it like?\u201d The man\u2019s eyes formed, and they were crazed and hungry with sparks of the Weeping Dragon. \u201cYou\u2019ve looked deeper into the Void than any living man. What did you see?\u201d\nZiel answered by crushing him again.\n\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Calling Storms shouted as he flew. He must have been speaking through a manipulation of aura, because his body wasn\u2019t intact enough for that. \u201cYes, that\u2019s what I wanted!

Yerin could capture the spirit for him, and he could keep the Remnant in his void key, slowly breaking it over time.\nA lance of blue-gold energy speared from the crumpled mass of flesh that was Calling Storms, and it pierced Ziel through the gut.\nHis spirit screamed out in familiar pain, though Ziel himself only grunted. He fell to his knees, body weak.\nWith a painful-sounding grinding and crunching, the Sage formed himself again. His spine straightened and his head inflated. He twisted his neck into place with one last click.\nThe insane smile on his face was unharmed.\n\u201cI could feel it, Brother Ziel!\u201d the Sage whispered. \u201cThe honesty of your anger would move the very heavens themselves. You\u2019re close to the truth. You just need a little more motivation.\u201d\nZiel swung a fist, but Calling Storms slipped aside. The Sage rubbed his chin thoughtfully as he scanned the battlefield.\nThen a blade of madra descended on him like the divine scythe Ziel had seen in Eithan\u2019s hands. Yerin took a blow from her own Herald opponent to strike at the Sage, and he could sense her rage.\nShe was scorched by the lightning of the Thunder Fairy, but she still landed on the Storm Sage like the wrath of the heavens. She blazed with crimson power, and Ziel only saw the flash of a black blade before the Sage fell to pieces again.\nThe laugh of Yushi, the Thunder Fairy, was so pleasant and melodious that it was out of place in a battlefield. \u201cDo you really want to keep fighting the two of us together? You must know this doesn\u2019t end well for you.\u201d\nYerin ignored her, speaking to Ziel instead. \u201cWhat happened to Lindon?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2026sent us here.\u201d For some reason, it felt like Ziel hadn\u2019t spoken for days. With every word, he remembered himself. \u201cHe didn\u2019t\u2026need us.\u201d\nScarlet fury flared from Yerin until she outshone the sun. Not at Ziel, he thought, though it was still overwhelming.\n\u201cDeal hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d Yerin said to Yushi. \u201cGive me a ride home before I paint you my favorite color.\u201d\nThe storm Herald laughed again. \u201cYour confidence is\u2014\u201d\nYerin\u2019s hit sent her through the clouds. Another pulse of blood aura would have stopped Calling Storms from regenerating, but a more refined will stopped Yerin\u2019s Ruler technique.\nThe Sage formed again, and this time he was laughing at Yerin. \u201cThe Reaper should have taught you better!\u201d he said. Then he shot a bolt of storm madra at Ziel.\nYerin knocked it aside with her sword and her spirit, though the impact shoved her back several feet. She retaliated instantly, sending six Striker blades from her Goldsigns.\nSomething twitched in his heart when he saw her stand in front of him, glowing with red moonlight. A distant whisper that, for a moment, he had forgotten.\nShe was standing where Ziel should be.\n\u201cEyes of heaven!\u201d the Sage of Calling Storm shouted. \u201cOpen my sight and help me to see!\u201d\nAn instant later, he called living lightning onto a seemingly empty spot.

The Storm Sage had crushed his future, making a mockery of his life\u2019s purpose. Was Ziel going to let him do it again?\nMaybe Ziel had only failed\u2026once.\nHe had done everything in his power to save his first sect. Now, he had a chance to do it again. That was who he had been, and who he could be.\nA guardian of his sect. A protector.\nA shield.\nThough he gained no more madra, something inside him shifted. And overhead, a massive steel shield formed across the sky.\nA serpent of lightning rushed at Mercy, but Ziel focused on her. He felt more himself than he had since his first duel against the Storm Sage, and his heart was calm.\n\u201cEndure,\u201d the Shield Sage commanded.\nA storm dragon washed over Mercy\u2026and passed, leaving her unharmed.\nThe Storm Sage whirled to Ziel and laughed maniacally, throwing his head back to heaven. \u201cLook! A fragment of the truth, revealed! Look what I have created!\u201d\nThe working had taken great effort from Ziel, and he had no madra left to fight for himself. But that was all right. That wasn\u2019t the role of a shield.\nMercy launched a powerful arrow at Calling Storms, who met it with madra directly. His sight had worn off, it seemed.\nIn the meantime, Yerin clashed against the Thunder Fairy again. The older Herald had the advantage, so that was where Ziel could make a difference.\n\u201cHold on,\u201d Ziel ordered, and reality changed so that she could.\nYerin accepted a hit to land one on her opponent\u2026but the sword that struck Yerin failed to penetrate her skin. Meanwhile, Yushi plummeted into the ground.\nCalling Storms leaped past another of Mercy\u2019s arrows, appearing over Ziel. He looked delighted, and he had a Striker technique prepared to hurl down on Ziel\u2019s head.\nThat was a lethal blow, certainly, but Ziel stayed focused on Yerin.\n\u201cProtect,\u201d Ziel ordered the world. His third working, not backed by any technique. His core was entirely empty, but the protection of his authority should give Yerin the edge. Without him to make her vulnerable, she would defeat both enemies. She and Mercy would walk away.\nHe wouldn\u2019t get his revenge, but at the moment, that didn\u2019t seem so bad.\nWas it really revenge he\u2019d wanted, anyway? Now he wasn\u2019t sure. All along, he had only wanted a chance to do it over.\nIn a flash of shadow, Mercy appeared in front of him, shrouded in armor. She shoved Ziel\u2019s powerless body away, and he hurtled back.\nThe Sage\u2019s technique devoured her.\nYerin crashed into Calling Storms an instant later, splattering him over the rocks.

They pounced on House Shen\u2019s weaknesses.\nIn a flash of light, the Thunder Fairy streaked up to them. Her face was dark, but her spirit was weak. The fight with Yerin had taken much from her.\nShe slammed her glowing sword away, and the Herald\u2019s words rang loudly. \u201cI am willing to send you safely to Lindon Arelius if you agree to leave me and the Sage unharmed. And immediately.\u201d\nYerin skidded to a halt next to Yushi. \u201cAgreed,\u201d she said immediately. From the feel of her spirit, she\u2019d aborted an attack halfway through.\n\u201cYes!\u201d Mercy called.\nThe body of Calling Storms merged back into solidity, and he was cackling the moment his lips re-formed. \u201cI have not had my fill of Death\u2019s apprentice.\u201d\n\u201cOh, really?\u201d the Thunder Fairy asked in feigned surprise. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to reunite the children of Death? Who knows what miracles they might create together?\u201d\nZiel could feel the insane thoughts crawling through the mind of the lunatic Sage. He looked as though he\u2019d received a divine revelation, though the Herald rolled her eyes behind him.\n\u201cI will cast the children of Death toward their older brother,\u201d the Sage said at last. \u201cBut on my own, I can never reach so far. Heralds, join your will to mine. Daughter of the Destroyer, grant me access to your Moonlight Bridge.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all wrung dry,\u201d Yerin said bitterly.\n\u201cEven so, it can provide me assistance. And I require the authority of another Icon.\u201d He reached out a hand. \u201cHow about some help, my friend?\u201d\nZiel\u2019s fury was deep and purely instinctive. His hammer was already crashing down on Calling Storms before the first conscious thought made it through his mind.\nBut he stopped his own weapon an inch from the Sage\u2019s face.\nThere was a discordant note from the Shield Icon. His own newborn connection to it flickered and weakened.\nHe was being offered a way to protect his current sect. As a guardian, he should take it.\nBut this was the man who had haunted Ziel\u2019s nightmares. He was right there.\nCalling Storms leaned around Ziel\u2019s hammer and gave him a frown. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to go back? Ah, I see. You were useless too long.\u201d He patted the hammer\u2019s head. \u201cVery well. I\u2019ll send the other two of you back, but my Dawnwing student stays with us. I have some more teaching to do.\u201d\nZiel\u2019s skin prickled and writhed as pure hatred coursed through his veins. Only the song of the Shield Icon kept him from striking out.\nIt wouldn\u2019t be too late to kill the Sage of Calling Storms after the others saved Lindon from the Dreadgod.\nHe could survive the man\u2019s attentions for a while. After all, he had endured them already.\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay,\u201d Ziel said shortly. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth\u2014\u201d\nYerin\u2019s fist cracked into the Sage\u2019s jaw.\nThe man\u2019s entire head deformed, and he tumbled for half a mile.

Anyone who met Yerin knew she had a temper, but she could keep it under control.\nYou wouldn\u2019t know it from looking at her, though.\nYerin\u2019s hair whipped wildly in the aura stirred by her spirit. Her eyes were wide and blazed with crimson rage. All six of her blade-arms were extended, and Netherclaw boiled with silver-and-scarlet madra.\n\u201cHe should have kept his teeth together,\u201d Yerin said, and Ziel heard the cry of the Bleeding Phoenix in the red moonlight all around her.\nYushi\u2019s own sword had returned to her hand. Her expression was frosty, and her wings crackled with lightning. \u201cA diplomatic solution would benefit the both of us. Don\u2019t think you can finish this quickly. Time is on our side.\u201d\nYerin wasn\u2019t looking at her. She gazed farther, to the regenerating Sage. \u201cOi!\u201d she shouted. \u201cYou want to see what Eithan would do to you? I\u2019ll give you a taste for free.\u201d\nShe gripped her sword in both hands and drew back the blade. Ziel was no swordsman, but her stance looked somewhat strange. Even awkward.\nOf course, he\u2019d seen her practice this before.\nSomething in his spirit shivered, and the colors around Yerin flickered out for a second. She was imitating Eithan. As he had been in the sky when he pulled back his scythe.\nHe wanted to stop her. Her outrage on his behalf was going to cost them their chance at getting back to Lindon.\nBut for just a moment, he was frozen in fear.\nAnd that cost him his chance.\nYerin unleashed the Reaper\u2019s Sword, and the battle began once more.", "c1588b18-2daa-4f84-9b06-88042fdd8ae2": "14\n\n\n\n\n\nLindon struggled awake to the thunder of battle and searing spiritual pain.\nThe gray-white echoed Titan clashed over Sacred Valley against its flesh-and-blood brother, and the sky blazed blue and gold with the madra of the Weeping Dragon. Lindon felt like he was boiling from the inside with excess power, but still his arm begged to feed on the two Dreadgods.\nDross panted in his mind. [Lindon, if you use Consume again before we\u2019re under control, I\u2019m going to strangle your brain.]\nWithout Dross\u2019 help, it was difficult to avoid passing out again. The Heart of Twin Stars was the only thing that allowed him to filter the powers he\u2019d stolen from Northstrider, and it felt like he was sorting six decks of cards at once.\nHe could have released the energy, but it supported him even as it wrestled him. And Northstrider\u2019s draconic authority would surely help his battle against the Weeping Dragon.\nWith every breath, the Dragon Icon sang its song inside him.\nIt filled him with arrogant confidence. If he admitted defeat here by abandoning Northstrider\u2019s power, he wasn\u2019t a true dragon. What kind of predator choked on his prey?\nAs Lindon was rooted to the spot, the Dreadgods clashed in the sky. The protective scripts around the Valley trembled, and Lindon suspected that if the Wandering Titan had been real instead of an echo of hunger madra, all of Sacred Valley would be dust.\nFrom a ragged hole in the world just beyond the protective script formation, someone staggered out. Northstrider.\nAlarm spiked through Lindon\u2019s spirit. If the Monarch could still fight, there would be little Lindon could do. He had stolen a large chunk of the man\u2019s power, which would be difficult to recover from, but Northstrider could potentially steal it right back.\nThe ragged Monarch was covered in dirt and blood. He coughed as he pulled himself out of the portal, and his own appearance finally matched the torn and scuffed condition of his clothes.\nHis eyes, however, were undefeated. He ignored Lindon and looked to the north and the battle between Dreadgods.\nHe extended a hand. \u201cAdmit defeat and give me the bow. I will not only spare you but save you.\u201d\nDross spun out into the air over Lindon\u2019s shoulder so they could both stare at Northstrider speechlessly.\nThe Monarch\u2019s gaze never wavered. \u201cCan you save yourself?\u201d\nLindon didn\u2019t have the concentration to spare for another negotiation with Northstrider. He flew slowly toward the Nethergate, where he could enter the labyrinth.\nIn fact, it wouldn\u2019t take much willpower to transport himself down into the labyrinth directly. But his mental and spiritual condition were tenuous enough as it was, and the labyrinth\u2019s power was being strained by projecting the Wandering Titan. He didn\u2019t want to push anything.\nInside the labyrinth, though, his options would expand. From there, it was relatively easy to move himself to another branch. Anywhere, as long as it was away from the Weeping Dragon.\nThe training plan had failed. Time to leave.\nNorthstrider grunted and followed him into the labyrinth\u2019s territory. \u201cStrength is not enough, Lindon. You need the wisdom to see the world as it is. If you keep ignoring reality, it will crush you.\u201d\nLindon turned to look over his shoulder and spared the Monarch one parting comment. \u201cWe will not stop,\u201d he said.\nHe continued moving toward the Nethergate, and he felt it distantly when Northstrider opened a portal and ran.\nBack to Moongrave.\nDross gave a whistling sound. [Wow, he admitted defeat. At any other time, I\u2019d give you a round of applause. But I think we\u2019re in trouble.]\nSerpents of living lightning tore mouthfuls of hunger madra out of the Wandering Titan. It was being ripped apart, and though it struck back at the Weeping Dragon with blows that ripped apart the air, it was clear that the battle was close to its end.\nLindon had hoped the echo would last longer, but this was hardly a surprising result. Not only was this Titan only a Forged projection, but it was also a copy of the Wandering Titan from a time before the Dreadgods had inherited the Slumbering Wraith\u2019s strength. The Dragon was on another level.\nAs Lindon picked up his speed and hobbled faster for the Nethergate, the sky boomed with the Weeping Dragon\u2019s voice.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know how to use my brother\u2019s techniques,\u201d the Dreadgod said. \u201cI will take your arm and all his remains.", "893bcbfb-f4c4-4547-9325-80e907842757": "But I think we\u2019re in trouble.]\nSerpents of living lightning tore mouthfuls of hunger madra out of the Wandering Titan.

They are my inheritance.\u201d\nLindon didn\u2019t respond to the Weeping Dragon, but Dross did. [The tiger tried to make deals with us too. Did you see what happened to him? I could show you.]\nThunder rumbled with the Dragon\u2019s response. \u201cNo. No deal. Whether you struggle or not, I will have what is mine. For I am the Dragon, and the sky weeps with my rage.\u201d\nWith that, there came a blinding flash. The entire sky blazed with a furious, crackling, swirl of blue.\nAnd the Weeping Dragon bit through the ghostly gray Wandering Titan.\nHunger madra dispersed along with one last roar from the Titan. The Dragon gave its own answering cry of triumph, and a thousand bolts of lightning flashed in celebration.\nCan you call for help? Lindon asked.\n[I realize I look healthy, powerful, and inspiring, but I\u2019ve been working as hard as you have. I\u2019m in no better shape than you.]\nThe Weeping Dragon swam through clouds, circling Sacred Valley. Storm clouds blocked out the shining blue sky, and wind whipped up.\nThe Dreadgod flicked its tail at the protective script, and the shield flashed into visibility for a moment.\nLindon reached the Nethergate and wrenched it open.\n[Too late!] Dross shouted.\nThe heavens opened and countless Striker techniques rained down.\nThey were the hallmark of the Weeping Dragon: draconic serpents of blue-and-gold lightning. Where they fell, they consumed spirits and brought them back to the Dreadgod.\nNow they rained in the millions, and all their attention was focused on Lindon.\nThe protective script of the Valley weakened them, but it didn\u2019t stop them entirely. They slipped through, swimming in the air with jaws open.\nLindon considered and discarded options in an instant. He could dive for the labyrinth, but the Weeping Dragon might be able to break it from the outside in. Which would endanger everyone inside, and transporting so many of them at once would drain much of the labyrinth\u2019s remaining power.\nHe wanted to use the Silent King Bow, but just the thought of summoning it made him shudder. He could barely hold it in his soulspace, much less use it.\nNeither he nor Dross could come up with a winning plan, so he called up the Hollow Domain. The blue-white light flickered at first, until he forced his madra into stability.\nThe Striker techniques dove into his Domain and weakened themselves further. He struck them from the air like he was tearing down cobwebs.\nBut there was an endless number of them, and he\u2019d been in constant battle with Monarchs. He was totally exhausted, and his movements looked unsteady and drunken.\n[We need to run,] Dross said sadly.\nThat costs us the labyrinth.\n[It\u2019s that or our lives.]\nThere was no simulation behind that prediction. Dross couldn\u2019t model the Weeping Dragon well and couldn\u2019t spare the madra or the attention to do so at the moment.\nIt was a judgment anyone could make in the situation. Besides running, what else could Lindon do?\nWith only another moment of hesitation, Lindon staggered through the Nethergate. Expanding his awareness into the labyrinth was usually simple, but now it was agonizing. It took several tries to even get it to work, and he shuddered to imagine what it would take to actually transport countless people.\nBut when his awareness entered the labyrinth, he heard something echoing from a distant corner of its scattered halls. A pattern of authority.\nFrom far away, beyond the reach of his spiritual sense, a Sage was calling his name.\nLindon, the distant voice said.

This wasn\u2019t an actual voice, just intentions translated through the labyrinth, so he didn\u2019t recognize the speaker. They claimed they were here to help, but if he summoned them here, he wouldn\u2019t be able to bring himself away.\nHe was tempted. This was a chance to keep the labyrinth.\nBut did this mysterious savior know they were about to go up against a Dreadgod?\nHe sent his own thoughts into the labyrinth. The Weeping Dragon is here, he sent.\nThe reply was only an instant in coming. Then hurry up!\nDross gave a mental shrug. [Give it a shot?]\nThe labyrinth shook as the Weeping Dragon struck again. Dirt fell from the ceiling, and the pressure inside and outside of Lindon\u2019s spirit redoubled. He forced himself to concentrate his willpower, one last time.\n\u201cHere,\u201d Lindon commanded. The labyrinth shifted around him.\nHis consciousness fuzzed. He barely avoided losing a grip on the stolen madra inside him, but he lost track of his surroundings.\nBoots clanked against stones. Several pairs of boots.\nA voice said something, but he couldn\u2019t hear it. A cold hand gripped his shoulder. \u201cThe bow, Lindon. Give me the bow.\u201d\nLindon struggled away, an instinctive reaction.\n[I think you should do it,] Dross suggested. [It will make it easier for us.]\nWith Dross\u2019 encouragement, Lindon reluctantly let the Silent King Bow slip from his soulspace. Without it inside him, the weight on his spirit lessened significantly, and he breathed more easily.\n\u201cThanks!\u201d A cheery voice said. \u201cYou can pass out now. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll probably give it back.\u201d\nLindon tried to protest, but he had truly hit his limit. He lost consciousness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nLarian gave a long, pleased hum as she ran her thumb down the Bow of the Silent King. \u201cNow this is a bow. Malice is going to be jealous.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to give it back,\u201d said Del\u2019rek of the Shann. Even in human form, the sacred elephant towered over her, and he gave her a pointed look over his tusks. \u201cI don\u2019t want a human Dreadgod after us.\u201d\nThe labyrinth shook, and Larian pointed a finger at the ceiling. \u201cHow about a dragon one?\u201d\nMost of the others grumbled. They weren\u2019t as happy to be here as she was.\n\u201cPull up your pants and get to work, Eight-Man Empire!\u201d Larian called. \u201cTime to earn our pay!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not getting paid for this,\u201d Kethri muttered. Larian considered the woman a sister, but the Spider Sage was always wary about entering open battle.\n\u201cOooohhh yes we are,\u201d Larian responded. \u201cNow\u2026\u201d She drew power from her comrades, and suddenly she was a Monarch. \u201c\u2026let\u2019s try out this bow.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nDespite being an Archlady now, Mercy felt like an outsider in the battle between Yerin, Ziel, Yushi, and the Storm Sage.\nTemporarily, she could borrow the power of a Herald and tilt the fight her way. But there was a difference between her and the others that she could only bridge for a few seconds at a time.\nShe sent arrows flying at the Thunder Fairy and helped Ziel evade the Sage\u2019s attacks, but the other two felt a passion she didn\u2019t. They were focused on killing their opponents.\nMercy was more worried about the broader battle.\nWhile the Sages and Heralds clashing had cleared a wide field around them, there was still a fight between House Arelius and House Shen.

If Yerin and Ziel could get a clear win, then of course they would tilt the battle in their favor. But a stalemate or inconclusive victory was more likely.\nHer family history showed her that Sages and Heralds were hard to kill. They almost always had ways to escape.\nThus, Mercy was in conflict with herself.\nHer mother would focus on the most important fighters on the battlefield. She would angle for a decisive victory over Shen\u2019s Sage and Herald, even if she had to plot against them and bring them down later. She never forgot a grudge.\nThat was Malice.\nWhat should Mercy do?\nHow should she use shadow madra to bring light?\nWhen she asked herself like that, her answer became clear. For one thing, the high-level battle meant nothing if the low-level one was lost.\nFor another, she had the opportunity now to help more people. House Arelius had been on the verge of destruction for years now. They needed hope.\n\u201cHold on!\u201d Mercy called to Ziel. His gaze flickered to her in evident surprise, but he couldn\u2019t afford more of a response than that, since the Storm Sage came riding in on the back of a Forged lightning dragon.\nMercy tapped her sixth page and her Shadestep technique. She melted through shadow and appeared a moment later behind the Arelius lines.\nThey were holed up in a building that was half-ruined and covered in ash, like most everything in eyesight. Some of the Lords targeted her with techniques immediately, but not as many as she\u2019d expected. Even most of those attacks cut off half-formed.\nMercy weathered the stray attacks on her armor and admired the Arelius bloodline gift. Their reaction speed and coordination were impressive, although that might have only been true when the Oracle Sage guided them.\nThinking of the woman must have summoned her, because Cladia Arelius stepped out of nowhere a moment later. The Sage of a Thousand Eyes indeed had many eyes of light madra swarming around her, like a cloud of bees. Her face was gently wrinkled but pleasant, her blonde hair streaked with gray and pulled back, and her dark blue robes were worn and disheveled.\nShe had clearly pushed herself hard for a long time now, but she didn\u2019t appear too urgent as she surveyed Mercy.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to help!\u201d Mercy said brightly.\n\u201cHmmmm,\u201d the Sage responded. \u201cEithan didn\u2019t leave a message for me, did he?\u201d\nMercy scratched the side of her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t get to talk to him before he ascended.\u201d\n\u201cPity. Well, I suppose he didn\u2019t get to pick his timing, did he?\u201d Eyes flew out from behind the Oracle Sage, and her head snapped to a corner of the battlefield. \u201cSee. Sorry, I\u2019m spreading myself thin as it is. How are you with taking orders?\u201d\n\u201cTell me where you need me!\u201d Mercy said enthusiastically.\n\u201cGreat.

They were operating a boundary field that manipulated aura all over the battlefield, bending wind and fire to push back Arelius troops.\nCladia was explaining the function of the script, but Mercy shot an arrow bound with the Dream of Darkness.\nThe script pushed against her Ruler technique, but enough people were affected by the nightmares of her Dream of Darkness that the formation weakened. She whipped Blades of Shadow at the boundary flags planted around the circle, and though the Blades were broken by techniques, a bombardment of Arelius Striker techniques hit at the same time.\nThat took enough pressure off that Mercy used Strings of Shadow to bind a group of a hundred Golds in a massive spiderweb.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d\n\u201cArchlord and his personal guard.\u201d The eye showed the coordinates.\nMercy focused. The Oracle Sage had clearly decided to pick up the pace. Mercy was a brand-new Archlady, and the man hovering over her\u2014engaged with a troop of Arelius Lords\u2014held a massive sword in both hands. He was weathered by the years, and her sense of him suggested a spirit honed by battle.\nThe pair of Overlords and trio of Underlords behind him worked in perfect concert, and all had quality weapons.\nThough they were focused on different opponents, she still wouldn\u2019t be a match for them. Not as she was, anyway.\nShe started to tap into the seventh page, but Cladia\u2019s voice echoed in her ear. \u201cYou just need to counter the Archlord. He was only a few seconds away from breaking through us and slaughtering my people. This should help you.\u201d\nThe Sage\u2019s next word didn\u2019t echo through the communication construct, but Mercy heard it nonetheless. She heard the command in her very soul.\n\u201cSee,\u201d the Sage of a Thousand Eyes commanded her.\nThe world clarified as though she\u2019d been blind a moment before.\nIt wasn\u2019t like borrowing the Arelius bloodline. Mercy understood that as strings of awareness that spread around and carried information.

All six members of the squad, including the Archlord, flew on their own separate clouds.\nWithin their ranks, Mercy wore her full-body armor and filled her limbs with the Dark Tide Incantation.\nAn Overlord tried to block her punch, but his arm broke. Mercy then dragged an Underlady from her cloud with Strings of Shadow, but that was as far as she got before she had to twist back to avoid the Archlord\u2019s sword.\nEven with her armor, she didn\u2019t underestimate the weapon. She dodged, using her Puppeteer Iron Body to control her body precisely. Combined with the Oracle Sage\u2019s foresight, it was almost effortless.\nShe felt like she could dodge a Monarch, and the sheer exhilaration of it made her giggle.\nThe Archlord\u2019s face darkened at that, and he gathered madra for a larger technique.\nOnly it was too late. The Arelius squad crashed into his, sweeping away his guards in an instant. He was forced to fly away, and Mercy dismissed her armor.\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d she asked.\nOnly then did her backup arrive. The Arelius Archlord was bleeding and panting heavily, carrying a spear, but he met Mercy\u2019s eyes and nodded his thanks.

A reasonable pace and we can hang on until your friends lend us support.\u201d The Sage\u2019s voice was strained, and Mercy could feel her spirit spreading all over the battlefield. She was making a rational decision, but Cladia Arelius was surely feeling more desperate than anyone else.\nHer people needed help.\nAnd something whispered to Mercy that she could help them. She could push further. She could shine more brightly.\n\u201cHow about an unreasonable pace?\u201d\nThe Sage let out a breath. \u201cHold for instructions.\u201d\nMercy killed a few seconds by launching arrows into some cloudships. The shots were stopped by aura barriers, but at least that would deplete the madra powering the scripts.\n\u201cAll right, Akura. I can\u2019t move you too fast with a gentle touch. You\u2019ll have to let me know when you\u2019re hitting your limits.\u201d\nMercy leaned forward. \u201cI\u2019ll try to find them!\u201d\nShe shot off, propelled by wind aura and Strings of Shadow, and the Sage of a Thousand Eyes guided her.

Always, the Sage of a Thousand Eyes was an annoying opponent, but she had a clear weakness: straightforward combat. Many ordinary Archlords could match her one-for-one.\nShe was dangerous as an advisor and a tactical coordinator, so the more of her attention she had to waste defending herself, the more useless she became.\nYushi and Calling Storms together were able to keep her in check, and they had been about to destroy the remaining powers of House Arelius with minimal losses.\nEven when Yerin and Ziel had showed up, she\u2019d thought there was little to worry about. They were young and new to their advancements, so eventually they would lose to their more experienced counterparts. Likewise, House Shen was stronger in every way than House Arelius, even with the presence of the Oracle Sage.\nThe first problem had been the Akura girl. With a combat-capable Archlady to work as her hands and feet, Cladia had become a much more dangerous opponent. They had turned the battle on the ground much more than Yushi had expected.\nEven so, that wouldn\u2019t have been enough. It would pressure them a bit, but Yushi and the Storm Sage could impact the battle while fighting.\nOr that should have been the case.\nYerin\u2019s strength was out of the ordinary, even for Heralds, but her Moonlight Bridge was exhausted and Yushi was quick. Yerin should have been simple enough to drive away.\nIf not for those sword-strikes that drained color from the world.\nThey carried a depth of authority that frightened Yushi, despite Yerin not being a Sage. Every black-and-white slash from Yerin seemed to carry a decree from Fate.\nIt would definitely land.\nAnd it would absolutely kill.\nIf Yerin had perfected such a technique, Yushi would have been dead already, but the idea of someone Yerin\u2019s age mastering such a profound technique was laughable. Even so, Yushi was feeling more pressure than she ever thought possible.\nYerin\u2019s attacks felt like they came from a Herald centuries old.\nYushi needed the Storm Sage\u2019s backup, and at first, she expected that he was playing around. As was his tendency.\nZiel, after all, had advanced even more recently than Yerin. His authority was clearly unstable, and his core was empty or close to it.\nBut the Storm Sage\u2019s frustration was transforming to blind fury in real time.\nZiel was too strong.\nIn terms of physical strength alone, he was a match for a newly advanced Herald. What had happened? Had Lindon figured out how to feed the man a Dreadgod?\nAnd even without madra, Ziel could operate his Divine Treasure to some degree. Whenever the Sage was about to catch him, he surrounded himself with rings of silver runes.\nReality twisted around him, and he slipped aside. With the acceleration of his time script, he couldn\u2019t be caught, and locking the Storm Sage in place for a moment was a guaranteed way to kill him.\nCalling Storms could regenerate even from total destruction, but of course there was a limit to the Divine Treasure that allowed it. Not even Monarchs had truly unrestricted regeneration.\nWhat Yushi and Calling Storms had expected to be a quick battle was turning into a drawn-out grind with their lives on the line. That had never been part of their calculation.\nThe tide of battle turning against their forces only sped up their deadline.\nAs she felt House Shen beginning to retreat, Yushi sent a coded message to the Storm Sage telling him to flee.\nIt pained her pride, but this battlefield wasn\u2019t worth throwing their lives away. And if the Sage of a Thousand Eyes freed herself to join the battle, it would turn from a slog into an execution.\nCalling Storms didn\u2019t respond, but Yushi didn\u2019t wait for him. She flared her wings and dashed away. If he died because he was too enraged to retreat, that was on his own head.\nAs she shot for the nearest Shen cloudship, she felt a warning in her spirit. A lance of light madra blasted at her, and she managed to twist her head aside at the last second.\nYushi glared at the source of the Striker technique.\nCladia Arelius gave her a distant, vague smile. More balls of light were forming around her.\nYushi ran lightning through her sword, prepared to annihilate the Sage. Thousand Eyes was slippery, surviving even a direct strike from the Weeping Dragon, but Cladia had people to protect this time. What she avoided, the Arelius family would have to block.\nThe Oracle Sage looked at something behind Yushi and nodded.", "939c4db7-42c3-4e9b-b956-efb327f46b11": "Calling Storms didn\u2019t respond, but Yushi didn\u2019t wait for him.

What she avoided, the Arelius family would have to block.\nThe Oracle Sage looked at something behind Yushi and nodded.\nAt the same time, Yushi felt what was happening and spun around. Silver runes flashed around Yerin, and her motions blurred as she moved for Calling Storms.\nHer sword passed through his neck.\nLightning exploded against her, and she staggered, but the protection of the Shield Icon was layered on her already-durable Herald\u2019s body.\nYerin and Ziel had turned on the Storm Sage the second that Yushi had tried to retreat. As though they\u2019d heard her call for the Sage to flee.\nOr as though they\u2019d been warned.\nBy an Oracle.\nYushi targeted Ziel with her technique, since he was a fresh Sage running on the last of his willpower. If he were struck directly, he wouldn\u2019t survive.\nA sword of pure lightning stabbed at him, but Yerin met it with a Forged crimson claw from her weapon\u2019s binding.\nAt the same time, something pinged painfully off the back of Yushi\u2019s skull. The Oracle Sage\u2019s attack.\nIt hurt no more than a pebble, but it infuriated her nonetheless. She glared at Cladia Arelius, who returned a small wave.\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Yushi finally said. The words had the bitter taste of swallowed pride. \u201cWe admit defeat.\u201d\nDanger screamed in her spirit, and the world turned gray.\nWith all her madra, she clashed against Yerin\u2019s sword. The slash was too difficult to dodge, but she found herself strained from meeting it.\nThen silver runes flashed behind her, and suddenly the entire world was moving too slowly.\nThat was when her premonition of danger turned to ice-cold terror.\nZiel was clearly out of madra, but he had still used a working of the Rune Queen\u2019s array to slow Yushi\u2019s time. She gathered willpower to push against it, returning the world to normal, but she couldn\u2019t fully break it and defend against Yerin at the same time.\nEvery technique she threw, Yerin dodged or weathered. She had the guidance of the Oracle Icon and the protection of the Shield Icon, on top of the strength of a Herald and an attack layered with deadly authority.\nThe pressure was enough to make Yushi feel as though she was facing down a Monarch.\nShe burned through every technique she had, including emergency life-saving constructs that were mowed down by Yerin\u2019s blade. Finally, she reached into her void key for her last resort: a high-quality gatestone that would take her immediately to Reigan Shen\u2019s side.\nIt was missing.\nThough Yushi was in the middle of a high-speed aerial fight, she still caught a glimpse of Cladia Arelius striding into view beneath her, casually juggling a gatestone.\nHow had she gotten it? When had she gotten it? How did the Oracle Icon allow one to steal from a sealed void space?\nIt didn\u2019t matter. The noose had settled around Yushi\u2019s neck.\n\u201cWait,\u201d she said to Yerin. \u201cMercy!\u201d\nYerin kicked her into the ground, which detonated beneath her. Spiritual pain radiated from her back as her wings, a Divine Treasure gifted to her by Reigan Shen, snapped from the impact.\nYerin jerked her chin into the distance. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for her.\u201d\nWhile Yushi was still thinking of another tactic, Yerin\u2019s blade took off her head.", "a19bc8bf-837c-4e6b-a4cd-65992dfca979": "It was missing.\nThough Yushi was in the middle of a high-speed aerial fight, she still caught a glimpse of Cladia Arelius striding into view beneath her, casually juggling a gatestone.\nHow had she gotten it?

Hunger radiated in a pattern that Ziel recognized as similar to Lindon\u2019s Consume technique. And power rushed into Yerin.\nShe was clearly caught off-guard, because she stiffened in place and her eyes rolled back into her head. This must have been what she was aiming for, but she wouldn\u2019t have any way to brace herself for a Herald\u2019s power suddenly flowing into her.\nZiel forced weary hands to lift his hammer. He had little left, but if he didn\u2019t move, they were all going to be killed by a Herald\u2019s Remnant.\nIndeed, Yushi\u2019s Remnant started forming only seconds after her death. It looked beautiful and inhuman, like a vaguely humanoid diamond that crackled with lightning and spread lacy wings.\nBut it didn\u2019t attack. It was bound with threads of crimson madra, woven around it like chains. In Ziel\u2019s mind, it felt connected to Yerin. Bound to her.\nSlowly, it drifted to stand behind Yerin.\nShe finally came out of her trance, breathing heavily and falling to one knee. \u201cBleed me,\u201d she panted. \u201cDidn\u2019t want one more whisper of her memories than I needed.\u201d Yerin turned to eye the Remnant behind her. \u201cGuessing you\u2019re the leftovers, are you?\u201d\n\u201cI am what you have not absorbed,\u201d the Remnant said, its voice echoing strangely. \u201cYou will digest me as you are able, and eventually we will merge.\u201d\nYerin rubbed one ear as though the words were physically painful to hear. \u201cHeard that one more than once.\u201d She looked to Ziel, and then to a writhing headless man on the ground. \u201cWhat\u2019s the plan with him?\u201d\nThe Storm Sage\u2019s regeneration had been much slower this time. Deadly authority infected his neck from the Reaper\u2019s slash that Yerin imitated, though Ziel suspected the man\u2019s Divine Treasure would have overcome it already if it hadn\u2019t been exhausted.\nA head was gradually growing from the Sage\u2019s neck, and Ziel looked down on him with a stomach full of fury.\nPossibilities passed through his mind.\nWith the Grand Oath Array, he could slow the man\u2019s suffering so that every second stretched into minutes. He could make the Storm Sage beg for what the man himself had done to Ziel.\nHe spun out that fantasy, hungry for it. But only for a moment.\nThen he weighed down the Sage\u2019s chest with his hammer and waited for the man\u2019s head to regenerate.\nAs soon as it had ears, Ziel spoke. \u201cI want you to know who killed you.\u201d He gripped the hammer tightly and thought of his own years of pain.\nThen he listened to the song of the Shield Icon.\n\u201cNo one else will suffer at your hands.\u201d With that, Ziel lifted his hammer.\nHe brought it down, but he had no Enforcer technique. Empowered by his strengthened body, the hammer still crashed onto him, but the Storm Sage caught it on both lightning-crackling hands. He lifted himself into the air on streams of aura, grinning a manic blood-stained grin.\nHe opened his mouth to speak.\nThen Yerin cut him in half.\n\u201cNope,\u201d she said. \u201cNot waiting for that.\u201d", "9769716a-e25e-4d52-a7f2-22992881e0e0": "16\n\n\n\n\n\nLindon returned to consciousness with a war raging inside his spirit.\nHis body was being torn apart from the inside; if not for his Bloodforged Iron body, he may have suffered irreparable damage. Without Lindon\u2019s will to suppress it, Northstrider\u2019s power thrashed around inside him like a trapped shark.\n[I\u2019m\u2026starting\u2026to regret this], Dross said. [He has so\u2026many\u2026memories.]\nLindon pushed himself up to a sitting position on the smooth stone floor of the labyrinth. A battle thundered outside, but he kept his senses contained. He focused entirely on controlling the power within him.\nHe needed to get rid of Northstrider\u2019s energy, but he didn\u2019t want to waste it.\n[If only there were vessels we\u2019d prepared specifically to receive your extra power,] Dross said.\nHe was referring to Orthos and Little Blue, whose presence would indeed solve this problem of Lindon\u2019s. Split among three people, they could digest Northstrider\u2019s power quickly, and it would dramatically benefit the advancement of the other two.\nBut Lindon didn\u2019t dwell on the thought. He didn\u2019t even allow himself to think about it too hard. They might feel his emotions through their contracted bond.\nUntil they were ready, he didn\u2019t plan to pressure them. He was here to carry them, not the other way around.\nThe best we can do is to cycle this as quickly as possible and vent the rest, Lindon responded. We\u2019ve held onto it too long.\nDross made a dismissive sound. They were doing that already, but they were too late to help with the battle against the Weeping Dragon.\nNothing to do but buckle down.\nLindon\u2019s spiritual sense locked onto his cores, and he lost himself in absolute focus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nWhen he felt Lindon\u2019s eyes close, Orthos opened his own.\nHe raised himself to all fours, power cycling through him. \u201cHe needs us,\u201d Orthos rumbled.\nLittle Blue gave a quiet, piping whistle.\nShe was hovering in midair, the ends of her dress and hair fluttering in a nonexistent wind. Little Blue was a paler shade of blue than usual, but she looked as solid as a human.\nAnd was much taller.\nTo them, it had been a week since Ziel and Mercy had left.\nArchlord natural treasures dissolved behind Orthos. Most of them had turned to soulfire that burned in his spirit at that very moment.\nLittle Blue, likewise, had finished the course Lindon had left for her.\nThey stood together, a pair of Archlords.\nThey had reached the end of their training regimen. Ideally, they would then sit and cycle for a few more days to stabilize their spirits and grow used to their new powers. But Lindon needed them.\nOf course, they still had to figure a way out.\nOrthos tried to signal Lindon, but he had cut himself off so that they wouldn\u2019t do exactly what they were planning on doing.\nThat only made Orthos more resolved.\nYerin and Ziel had escaped by cutting through the Way, but Orthos and Little Blue couldn\u2019t do that. They could perhaps force open the original entrance to the pocket world with sheer willpower, but that would be much easier from the outside than the inside.\nThere was only one option left: the network of defensive constructs that had surrounded the pocket world\u2019s entrance.\nOrthos strode to the control room. \u201cI\u2019ll try to signal someone. Grab the tank.\u201d\nLittle Blue whistled and gave a wave as a salute, then scurried off to grab Lindon\u2019s secret project. As Orthos was still figuring out which of the scripts were operational and which outside constructs remained functional, Blue scurried back with a tank several sizes bigger than her body held over her head. Five purple orbs drifted in fluid within.\nHe settled down and tried to send a message. He just had to hope someone on the other side was listening.", "a73e4c21-2752-4d76-b606-655bb10231ce": "* * *\n\nSweat ran down Larian\u2019s face. Well, most of it was sweat. Some was blood.\nShe couldn\u2019t stay a Monarch all the time. Others of the Empire needed to borrow the power of the group when they were hitting the Weeping Dragon, or when they had to take a hit that would have killed them otherwise.\nEventually, Del\u2019rek would lend her the restoration authority to fix her injuries. Like her twisted spine, her strained madra channels, and her missing eye.\nBut they had to survive first.\nMore than her injuries, she was focused on the Silent King Bow. Metaphysically speaking, it was heavy. Most of the damage to her spirit had come from her own use of the bow.\nHer opinion of Lindon slid upwards. How did he manage to use the weapon as long as he had?\nNonetheless, it was their most effective weapon against the Dragon. She wrapped her spirit around the Bow, focusing her willpower and pulling back the string.\nLindon may have the muscle to use the weapon, but he wasn\u2019t a Bow Sage. She could do things with arrows that he couldn\u2019t imagine.\nAs long as her soul didn\u2019t break.\nThe Weeping Dragon turned to her the moment he felt the Bow in use, and she Forged a white arrow onto the string. It blasted toward him, and the Dreadgod gave that missile the full force of his attention.\nGood thing, too.\nThe arrow disappeared before it was struck by lightning, twisted around a massive claw, pressured the Dragon\u2019s thoughts, and landed where the Dragon was fated to be.\nWhen the arrowhead sank in, the Dragon writhed. Its roar threatened to burst her eardrums, and she could feel its thoughts trembling before the mental power of the Silent King.\nLarian coughed up a mouthful of blood, and the Bow fell from nerveless fingers.\nDropping her weapon in battle. That was embarrassing.\nShe wanted to pick it up, but her body wouldn\u2019t listen. The time had come for her exit; she wasn\u2019t much more than a liability to the others in this condition.\nBut as she called a cloud to pick her up, she noticed something. A half-broken construct projecting a few fuzzy characters into the air.\n\u201cPocket world,\u201d they said. \u201cTrapped.\u201d\nNo matter how weak she was, Larian\u2019s perception was sharp. Now that she was looking for it, she spotted the warped scar in space that represented the collapsed entrance to a pocket world.\nOrdinarily, she could open it in a second.\nThis time, she called her comrade.\nKharrus, Herald of the Nine-Hands, had already been flying toward her on a cloud. He was quiet but even-tempered, reliable, and he radiated a desire to be out of here.\nShe indicated the warp, in the ocean far to the north. \u201cTrapped in there. Could be Arelius\u2019 apprentices.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t ask any further questions, he just pulled back his axe and loaded it with his will. With one slash, he tore the world open right in front of him.\nThen he dashed back into the fight, deflecting a volley of living lightning before it could crash down on Larian. He left a cloud behind him, for her.\nA portal opened into a swirl of blue, and two people walked out. But not ones Larian recognized.\nThe Archlord man had weathered, tar-black skin and gray hair. He wore dark leather that looked as though it had been made from dragon hide, with bits of armor strapped to it.\nThe Archlady had navy hair the color of the deep ocean and skin like a summer sky. She carried a tank of something under one arm. Something that felt spiritually powerful.\nLarian would have asked what a couple of Archlords were doing inside a pocket world that had been constructed by the Void Sage, but she recognized their eyes and the feel of their madra.\nThe Lord\u2019s were black with circles of bright red while the Lady\u2019s were blue with circles of white. Larian had seen eyes like that before.\nShe jerked a thumb in the direction of the largest gate into the labyrinth, the one etched with a stylized depiction of the Slumbering Wraith. \u201cHe\u2019s in there.\u201d\n\u201cWe know,\u201d the man said in a deep, rumbling voice. \u201cThank you for your help.\u201d\nThe woman dipped her head in agreement. \u201cMm-hmm!\u201d\nLightning fell from the skies like rain, and both newcomers ignited full-body Enforcer techniques. They sprang up like fire from each of them, the woman\u2019s a smooth, blue-white flame while the man\u2019s was a rough black-and-red blaze.\nThe two nodded to her, then dashed off. Larian had to hope they could survive in a Dreadgod\u2019s presence long enough to reach Lindon.\nBecause there wasn\u2019t much else she could do to help.", "9affcaa8-ddf2-4754-8fed-9d339e687dc7": "* * *\n\nLindon still wrestled with his spirit when he heard Dross give a delighted gasp. [Yay, you brought my project! And also, I\u2019m glad to see you. Of course. That goes without saying, which is why I didn\u2019t say it.]\nLindon withdrew from his cycling trance to see Orthos. He\u2019d already felt the turtle standing in front of him, which was why he was taken aback to see a man.\nOrthos was human, with the same wrinkled black skin as before but a head full of gray hair. It was strange to see age on him as a person; Lindon had always known Orthos was old, but it wasn\u2019t as though he was used to telling young turtles apart from old ones. Gray hair and wrinkles on a human form had far more impact.\nIn some ways, though, Little Blue was more startling.\nRather than a spirit, she resembled a woman made up to look like one. Her skin was pale blue, but solid and opaque, and her deep navy hair was actually hair.\nIf he hadn\u2019t sensed their connection, he might have doubted their identities. Though their eyes were the same.\nAnd Blue gave a loud cheer when she saw him, running over and throwing herself into him with arms wrapped around his neck. Orthos folded his own arms across his chest and snorted smoke.\n\u201cI thought you knew we could do it,\u201d Orthos grumbled. \u201cYou look shocked.\u201d\nLindon held out his left hand to Orthos. \u201cIt\u2019s not over yet.\u201d\nOrthos clasped Lindon\u2019s palm, and Lindon pushed Northstrider\u2019s power out through their bond.\nThe grip tightened as Orthos stiffened, and Lindon felt him struggling with the sudden influx of madra and willpower. The weight he was bearing lifted from Lindon, and relief spread through Lindon\u2019s spirit like a sigh.\nBut it wasn\u2019t only madra that Lindon intended to pass on. He focused on the Dragon Icon, on the authority that had come from Northstrider. The same that he felt from the Weeping Dragon, and what he\u2019d sensed from Seshethkunaaz.\nHe had a thousand memories of dragons, and now he understood what they meant. Dross helped him convey that meaning to Orthos.\nNo one had spent longer meditating on the nature of dragons than Orthos.\nThe Dragon Icon clicked like a key into a lock, covering the ceiling of the labyrinth in its image. A realistic, fully rendered image of a long, serpentine black dragon.\nOrthos\u2019 power suddenly expanded, growing deeper and broader. This transformation wasn\u2019t as dramatic as most advancements, but it was even more fundamental.\nRed-on-black eyes lowered to meet Lindon, and Lindon saw a spark of fire in their depths. The authority of a Dragon Sage.\nHis grip tightened around Lindon\u2019s hand as Orthos exerted as much strength as he could to test his newfound power.\nLindon gave him an apologetic look. This wasn\u2019t a fair contest. Orthos was trying to strangle a boulder.\nDark eyes narrowed, and the Icon overhead gave a defiant roar. \u201cStronger!\u201d Orthos commanded, and the word carried the authority of a dragon.\nUnder the Sage working, Orthos\u2019 grip tightened to the point that the world warped slightly around their hands.\n\u201cWell done!\u201d Lindon said in an encouraging tone.\nLittle Blue\u2019s tinkling laughter sounded strange coming from a human throat.\nOrthos growled to himself, focusing everything he had on his grip. \u201cAll right, show me what you can do.\u201d\nLindon hesitated. \u201cThat\u2019s not a fair\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI have to know.\u201d\nAs Orthos wished, Lindon tightened the grip of his human hand.\nSage bodies couldn\u2019t conduct willpower like a Herald\u2019s could, though strength-related Icons like the Dragon Icon helped. But Lindon\u2019s body was halfway between a Herald\u2019s and a Dreadgod\u2019s. Most comparable to a Monarch\u2019s.\nHe was physically powerful enough to match fists with Northstrider, so this was, truly, an unfair contest.\nOrthos resisted for a second or two before his authority was completely overwhelmed. His bones began to creak, and his hand trembled involuntarily.\n\u201c\u2026All right!\u201d he shouted at last. Lindon released him.\nOrthos pulled back his twisted claw of a hand, muttering to himself. \u201cFeels like there\u2019s no getting close to you, no matter what I do. For every step I take, you\u2019ve taken two.\u201d\n\u201cTake two steps,\u201d Lindon suggested.\nOrthos spat a burst of fire madra into Lindon\u2019s face. Of course, it did nothing.\nLittle Blue shook Lindon back and forth by the shoulders.", "7b1c874e-4a9f-42d4-b4c9-5a349cc34910": "But Lindon\u2019s body was halfway between a Herald\u2019s and a Dreadgod\u2019s.

Of course, it did nothing.\nLittle Blue shook Lindon back and forth by the shoulders. She didn\u2019t say anything that could be called communication, even by her usual standards, but Lindon could translate the feeling he was getting through her contracted bond. \u201cMe next!\u201d\nHe looked into her oceanic eyes. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re ready?\u201d\nShe responded enthusiastically with wordless cheers, even releasing him to jump up and down.\nLindon had already begun the process of moving them to another chamber, but he still reflected that seeing Little Blue act like a foot-tall spirit while in the body of a grown human woman was\u2026strange.\nThe labyrinth shifted around them, to a mostly empty room. He had chosen this one because it was surrounded by scripts that would seal off excess power, which was important in the advancement to Herald.\nWhen they arrived, Little Blue dropped to her knees and held out her left hand. He took it and tapped into his pure core.\nAt this level, she could handle the full density of his madra. Northstrider\u2019s powers wouldn\u2019t help her as much as they\u2019d helped Orthos, but there were still benefits. His blood essence, in particular\u2014his physical strength\u2014would help her form a real body. As much as she looked like a human now, she was still fundamentally a spirit.\nThat was about to change.\nHe could feel Little Blue\u2019s concentration, impatience, and firm will.\nSo he flooded power into her, to trigger her advancement to Herald.\nHis pure madra filled up her core from the inside while Northstrider\u2019s blood and life essence soaked into her body.\nDross popped up next to Lindon\u2019s head. [Remember, for spirits, the process of advancing to Herald is\u2014] Flesh wove around Little Blue\u2019s body as she guided her spirit to manifest physically. [\u2014oh, you get it. You\u2019re doing it. Good for you, then.]\nThe process of absorbing and purifying so many Blood Shadows had helped Little Blue in more ways than one. Her understanding of herself and the nature of spirits had surpassed most Archlords. Maybe even Lindon\u2019s.\n[Not mine,] Dross whispered to him. [There are advantages to never being weighed down by bloated, meaty flesh.]\nSpirits reached Herald in the opposite way that humans and sacred beasts did. Rather than manifesting their Remnant and integrating with it, they had to form their spirits into a body.\nWhich Little Blue did with no problems.\nNow, she imposed her will onto reality, creating a real vessel for herself.\nAura and soulfire raged around her. Not that this process needed natural treasures, but she now radiated dream and blood aura in a way she hadn\u2019t before.\nFinally, the storm of power settled down, and Little Blue opened her eyes. They were similar to the eyes she had before\u2014the same eyes Lindon had once shown when he tapped into pure madra\u2014but now they glistened like jewels.\nFrom a seated cycling position, Little Blue stuck both fists into the air. \u201cYay!\u201d she said.\nLindon felt his, Orthos\u2019, and Dross\u2019 surprise at the same time.\n\u201cBlue?\u201d Lindon asked hesitantly. \u201cCan you\u2026speak?\u201d\n\u201cMmm-hmmm!\u201d Little Blue said.\nDross drifted around her to see her from every angle. [There\u2019s no reason she shouldn\u2019t. She knows the words. Say something! Say\u2026 \u201cDross!\u201d]\nLittle Blue flicked Dross in the forehead. When he blasted across the room and slammed into the wall, she giggled.\nThe wall of the labyrinth didn\u2019t break, of course, but Dross\u2019 form tumbled to the floor. He drifted up a moment later, purple eye glaring. [That hostility was not warranted.]\nLittle Blue stuck out her tongue.\n\u201cYou need a proper name now,\u201d Orthos said. \u201cLittle Blue is not the name of a person.\u201d\nLittle Blue nodded and pointed to her own nose.", "9c670024-d329-4aa3-9935-b2347fb343a4": "Lindon felt his, Orthos\u2019, and Dross\u2019 surprise at the same time.\n\u201cBlue?\u201d Lindon asked hesitantly. \u201cCan you\u2026speak?\u201d\n\u201cMmm-hmmm!\u201d Little Blue said.\nDross drifted around her to see her from every angle.

But it makes you sound like a pet.\u201d\n[Or a mascot!] Dross suggested. [For a business. We saw a \u2018Little Blue Fishing Company\u2019 in Moongrave, didn\u2019t we, Lindon? We did.]\nBlue turned to Lindon, so he asked her. \u201cDo you want another name?\u201d\nShe shook her head rapidly, sending blue hair flailing.\n\u201cAll right, then. Little Blue it is.\u201d\n[We can do better than that!] Dross insisted. [Yerin named the Blood Shadow Ruby. How about Sapphire?]\n\u201cAlataraxa,\u201d Orthos offered.\n[Why would you suggest that? You want to go from the easiest name in the world to one that only dragons can say?]\n\u201cIt was my mother\u2019s name.\u201d\nDross paused for a moment. [\u2026I feel like I\u2019m supposed to compliment the name now, but I still don\u2019t like it.]\nOrthos glared at him.\nLindon patted Little Blue on the head. \u201cThey don\u2019t listen to me either.\u201d\n[How can we listen when she hasn\u2019t said anything?] Dross asked.\nBlue extended a hand to Orthos, and Orthos looked down to it. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d he asked.\nShe shook her hand impatiently.\n\u201cI think she wants to try out her grip,\u201d Lindon suggested.\n\u201cMm!\u201d Blue said.\nOrthos extended his right hand to grip hers. Lindon would have to give him an elixir to help his left hand recover faster.\nWith total concentration, Blue squeezed down.\nLindon could feel Orthos\u2019 panic as a newborn Herald began to crush his hand. \u201cStronger!\u201d he commanded again.\nThen his own hand closed, and it was Blue\u2019s turn to frown. They struggled for almost a minute, each trying to force out another ounce of strength. Space bent slightly around them, and Lindon became concerned that they could do some real damage to one another.\nBlue could recover in the way of Heralds, but he was more concerned for Orthos. The Dragon Icon had no authority over healing that Lindon was aware of, and they didn\u2019t have much time for elixirs to work.\nHe reached out and grabbed both wrists. \u201cLooks like a draw, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\n[No! Let them fight!]\nThey continued to grip each other for another moment until Lindon tightened his own. \u201cIt\u2019s a draw,\u201d he said.\nWith that, they both released. Orthos flexed his hand, grumbling, but Little Blue made an excited sound and threw her arms around Orthos\u2019 shoulders.\n\u201cWhat are you celebrating for?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt was a draw!\u201d\n\u201cMmm!\u201d\nHe hesitated before returning the embrace. \u201cYes. Well done.\u201d\nFrom their spirits, Lindon could read their feelings. Orthos was embarrassed to have only tied with Little Blue, though he had been many times her size and strength for most of their acquaintance.\nBlue came from the opposite side, so she was delighted. At last, she had matched Orthos for strength.\n[This is heartwarming. My heart is warmed. But didn\u2019t we have somewhere else to be?]\nDust fell from the ceiling again as all the terrain trembled, and Lindon settled his own spirit. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Stay behind me and do what Dross tells you to do.\u201d\nHe had hoped to face down the Weeping Dragon with all seven of them, but everything had gone wrong.\nNow, they\u2019d have to try their best with four.", "1ebb50f5-a719-496e-9ea6-86c6a24f6775": "17\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutside Sector 30\nThe Void\n\n\nA fragment of the Mad King floated in the endless chaos of the Void.\nSomewhere nearby, and yet endlessly far away, his true self was engaging in battle with Ozriel. This version of himself was only a fragment, a skeletal copy of the Mad King left to accomplish a task.\nBut even a shadow of the Mad King was more than enough to dominate the collection of weak, hollow creatures arrayed before him.\nHe had personally arranged for Haven, the prison-world of the Abidan, to be broken open. Its inmates had spread, bringing discord to the Abidan worlds, as he\u2019d intended. At least, most of them had.\nThe fragment of the Mad King had gathered these fifty individuals to him, those with potential that he could snap up before they were caught. They would be no serious threat to anyone, but under his direction, they could be a distraction and a potential poison.\nAnything to cause chaos.\nSome had found or made clothes for themselves, but most of the fifty hadn\u2019t cared to do so. They still wore the simple white cloth provided to Haven prisoners.\nAnd they glared at him, though not while they thought he could see them.\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d one demanded through a mouthful of thick fangs. He was a ten-foot-tall humanoid animal, like a man crossed with a bear, with yellowed teeth too big for his jaws.\nThe Mad King remembered his file. Kash-Nagh had crafted a cursed virus that would carry his condition, turning others into bestial creatures driven only by violence and hunger. That alone would not have drawn the attention of the Abidan, except that the beast-man had cast this virus into neighboring worlds.\nThat had earned him a stay in Haven. The Mad King considered Kash-Nagh to be among the more promising prospects here.\nNonetheless, he drilled into the man with his fiery gaze until Kash-Nagh dropped his eyes.\n\u201cUntil everyone has arrived, we wait,\u201d the Mad King said. \u201cIf I choose never to give you instructions, you will die waiting.\u201d\nA woman let out a hissing laugh. She was hooded in white, her mouth covered in the same color, and she played with liquid shadow between her hands. \u201cOoohhh, scary, scary! Were we not worth your full attention, my lord?\u201d\nThe Mad King favored her with an answer. \u201cYou are not.\u201d\nThere was a general murmur among the prisoners. Some spoke in agreement, some in fear, some in anger, and some in shock.\nSome were more experienced than others and had seen through his nature. The Witch of Kaseri was one such, an accomplished practitioner of her world\u2019s energy system and manipulator of the Void. She felt the emptiness of the Mad King\u2019s form.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell?\u201d the Witch\u2019s voice was mocking. She drifted up to the Mad King and patted him on the cheek. \u201cThis is a charcoal sketch. It\u2019s half a memory. Watch this.\u201d\nShe split the ink spilling between her fingers into a web. Beneath the white of her mask, she was smiling.\nThe Witch sunk the strings of dark ink into the substance of his being. He was somewhat familiar with how she operated. This was a working of chaotic authority, intended to subvert control over what she saw as a puppet.\nNo matter how strong the original Mad King was, his fragment could never have a full, living will behind it. Only whatever tiny, miniscule percentage of his willpower he had chosen to invest in its creation.\nA sound theory. The Witch was wise enough to understand that he was a projection and realize the opportunity it granted her.\nAnd foolish enough to think that gave her power over him.\nThe Void in which they floated was not pure darkness. Pieces of dead worlds floated all around them, contained in balls of light like vibrating, swirling stars. The nature of the Void itself tried to break down those pieces, as well as anything here that truly existed. If you knew how to sense it, the Void felt like a constant humming, as it chewed at existing beings and tried to unmake them.\nThe Mad King\u2019s fragment attuned himself to that energy and then focused it on the Witch.\nIn a matter of a second or two, she went through several stages. First, she lost physical cohesion as the laws holding her body together broke down. Her body parts changed shape, twisting and bloating, other pieces shrinking into themselves until she was a hideous half-melted mockery difficult to recognize as having been human.\nSecond, she was broken down into a more conceptual state, infected by her own authority.

Some were hungry for this chance at revenge while others had their fear of the Abidan branded into them.\nHe could work with both.\n\u201cI have tasks for each of you,\u201d the Mad King went on. \u201cSome will return to your home worlds to bring a new order while others will carry out my will. The chaos you spread will ensure that the Abidan never fully recover. You are my twist of the knife. I have broken the pillars of their house, and now you will burn it to the foundations.\u201d\nSome of the prisoners cheered. Kash-Nagh growled. Others winced and steeled themselves. None protested.\nAt least, none who had seen what happened to the Witch.\n\u201cWhy should we?\u201d one of the two newcomers demanded.\nThose around him, the ones who had witnessed the King\u2019s demonstration, didn\u2019t wait to hear an answer.

They slowed her enough for more and more to land.\nThe Weeping Dragon blasted a line of madra into the sky, then followed up with a swipe from its claw. She felt the sacred artist it was after, and she pushed her lips into a grin.\n\u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d she forced out.\nBlue-white madra passed over her in a tide, and the Dragon\u2019s animated techniques were weakened enough that her own passive resistance to madra and the remainder of her armor wiped them out in an instant.\nLindon followed the edge of his technique, holding a Hollow Domain over her.\nAnd over the entire mountain.\nThe sphere of madra stretched for miles, forming an umbrella against the passive Striker techniques of the Weeping Dragon. It would take a direct act of the Dreadgod to push through the Domain with enough strength to hurt someone on their level.\nLarian sank down onto the snow in relief, pushing away the pain. Now that she could focus better, she could finally hold the Silent King Bow again.\n\u201cHope you figured something out,\u201d she said, looking up to him.\nHe stood over her, and while he kept his eyes on the Dreadgod, he held out his left hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll see.

It was lethal authority condensed into solid form. She\u2019d fought Heralds on death-aspect Paths who weren\u2019t as deadly as that weapon.\nAfter her first impression, she recognized it, of course.

This one wouldn\u2019t be able to kill a Monarch or a Dreadgod without resistance.\nBut it would go a long way toward getting the job done.\nLarian held out the bow with creaking joints. This situation was urgent, but she couldn\u2019t seem to part the weapon from her hand.\nLindon snatched it away, and her soul hurt from more than all the spiritual injuries.\n\u201cMake me another one!\u201d she insisted. \u201cLook at that dragon! Look what a great bow he\u2019d make!\u201d\nWhen Lindon nocked the arrow to the string of the Silent King Bow, a dark Icon formed in the sky. He radiated such authority that even the Weeping Dragon spun around, its motion whipping up a hurricane.\nLindon shot into the sky to meet the Dreadgod in combat, but Larian called after him.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be from a Dreadgod! I\u2019ll take Malice\u2019s bow once you\u2019re through with her! Later? All right, we\u2019ll talk later.\u201d\nShe cycled her madra when the Hollow Domain passed away from her, but even doing so little made her stumble. In a much graver voice than she usually showed the world, Larian spoke into the communication construct within her armor. \u201cEight-Man Empire, retreat.\u201d\nThe Weeping Dragon\u2019s attention was off them. It couldn\u2019t stop their transportation without taking its eyes from Lindon. Now was their best chance.\nTwo of her companions vanished immediately, crushing their gatestones as though they had been waiting to leave at any second. The others followed a moment later, though someone else had to scoop up the two injured members.\nLarian was the last to leave, frustrated. She hated retreating, but she would hate losing even more.\nThis was a good cause, she knew. The only cause worth giving their lives for.\nAs long as they won.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nEven on the Rosegold continent, Yerin felt the battle of the Weeping Dragon. Her body ached with the spiritual effort she\u2019d put into her fight already, and energy raged in a chaotic swirl inside of her.\nShe\u2019d devoured power from the Storm Sage and the Thunder Fairy, and the helpful parts of their spirits now dissolved into hers. The rest, she dragged along.\nThe Remnants floated behind her, a crackling winged person formed as though grown from diamond and a twisted dragon-man with a grin far too large for its body. The Remnants of a Herald and a Sage.\nYerin wrestled with their wills even now, but they weren\u2019t exactly opposing her. Most of what she felt from them was confusion. The crimson chains that wrapped them slowly fed her power.\nOr they would once she had room for more. At the moment, she was capped out.\nBetween the pain and the burden she was now carrying, she wanted to fall back onto a bed. But somebody was fighting the Weeping Dragon, and it felt too much like Lindon.\nZiel had stowed his Grand Oath Array. Despite all the strengthening elixirs Lindon had fed him, it looked like he would fall over if he couldn\u2019t lean on his hammer.\nMercy was equally tapped out, but they were all dancing to the same tune when it came to their words.\n\u201cYou can send us back home!\u201d Mercy said encouragingly to the Oracle Sage. \u201cI know you can do it!\u201d\nCladia Arelius looked doubtfully between the three of them. \u201cIf I could, I\u2019m not convinced I should. Look at yourselves.\u201d\n\u201cSend us,\u201d Ziel said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to be an oracle to see that you\u2019re all on your last legs.\u201d\n\u201cSend us,\u201d he repeated.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to get far talking to him, am I?\u201d the Sage asked, turning to Yerin.\nShe had turned to the wrong person.\n\u201cSend us,\u201d Yerin said.\nThe Sage of a Thousand Eyes spread her hands like Eithan had when he was feeling especially put-upon.", "a4ade19e-ef57-4130-90ee-e0a7e126eddf": "Mercy was equally tapped out, but they were all dancing to the same tune when it came to their words.\n\u201cYou can send us back home!\u201d Mercy said encouragingly to the Oracle Sage. \u201cI know you can do it!\u201d\nCladia Arelius looked doubtfully between the three of them. \u201cIf I could, I\u2019m not convinced I should.

Do you know what will happen if you lose control of those Remnants?\u201d\n\u201cNot planning to.\u201d\nCladia looked into the air for a second, then summoned a globe of light in one hand. \u201cShow them,\u201d she ordered.\nImages filled the light. They were hazy images, brief glimpses caught through a keyhole, but they were clear enough.\nYerin\u2019s captured Remnants threw themselves eagerly into the mouth of the Weeping Dragon. The spiritual impact caused her to collapse and her techniques to fade. The Dreadgod\u2019s power swelled, and it turned on Ziel next.\nWhile the view was too rough to tell what happened to everyone specifically, Ziel and Mercy didn\u2019t last long. Then the Dragon turned its full focus onto Lindon.\nThe Oracle Sage crushed the light in her hand. \u201cThat\u2019s the most likely future if you join Lindon in battle now.\u201d\n\u201cBut not the only future!\u201d Mercy put in brightly.\n\u201cPeople make too much of that. Would you walk into a room if you knew there were only a thirty percent chance it would kill you?\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Ziel said.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the other seventy?\u201d Yerin asked.\nMercy nodded. \u201cTo save someone? Of course!\u201d\nThe Oracle Sage surveyed the three of them and shrugged. \u201cYeah, all right. Eithan would have done the same thing. Come on.\u201d\nShe started to trudge away, but Yerin was suspicious of that. There should be no reason to walk anywhere.\nMercy followed the Sage, but Ziel ground his hammer into the dirt. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we do it here?\u201d\nCladia spoke without turning around. \u201cIf I take you myself, we won\u2019t get there until tomorrow night. Even if you all helped me, the fastest would be\u2026let\u2019s say four, five hours. And that would leave us all exhausted when we arrived.\u201d\nYerin\u2019s stomach twisted as she imagined Lindon in battle against a Dreadgod alone for four straight hours. She spoke firmly. \u201cThen we don\u2019t have time to waste on talking, true?\u201d\nThe Oracle Sage waved impatiently. \u201cJust follow me. And walk, by the heavens. Now will be your last chance to rest. Maybe for the rest of your life.\u201d\nImpatience gnawed at Yerin, but Eithan had trusted her. And it wasn\u2019t as though she had any motivation to work against them.\nYerin had paid attention to their surroundings only as terrain to fight over. Now she saw the Sage was leading them to a network of ruins. It looked like the foundation of what had once been a town and was now a rocky maze covered in ash.\nThe Arelius clan had brushed some of that ash away, making their home among the ruins and half-standing walls. Now it was bustling like a market-day as weapons were repaired and wounds were tended to, but they looked as though they hadn\u2019t been here long.\nCladia led them to a staircase that led down into the ground. A heavily wounded Arelius Archlord bowed to Mercy when she passed, and she waved cheerily back.\n\u201cFor thousands of years, House Arelius had holdings on multiple continents,\u201d the Oracle Sage told them as they walked down into the ground. \u201cI think you\u2019ve heard some of this story before. In order to help secure territory all the way in Ashwind, our ancestors constructed a spatial tunnel between the two. It\u2019s not as advanced as the labyrinth, and it takes quite a bit of energy. Therefore, it only opens itself once every ten years.\u201d\nYerin brightened as a large doorframe came into view. It was large enough to drive a pair of wagons through, supported on either side by a scripted pillar and with the Arelius family crest over the top.\nIn the center, filling the doorway, blue energy swirled.", "d004dd7f-4571-4703-8873-ac6b1d96dbcb": "Cladia led them to a staircase that led down into the ground.

It was large enough to drive a pair of wagons through, supported on either side by a scripted pillar and with the Arelius family crest over the top.\nIn the center, filling the doorway, blue energy swirled. Since advancing to true Herald, her spiritual sense had become much more sensitive than before, and she could feel detailed fluctuations she couldn\u2019t before.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re telling me that portal\u2019s ready, I\u2019m calling you a liar,\u201d Yerin said.\nCladia put hands on her hips as she stood beside Yerin. \u201cIt is almost time for the portal to open on its own, but not quite. Thus, we\u2019re burning all the natural treasures we can to fill it up. Trick it into opening, so to speak. Normally, that wouldn\u2019t work\u2014it\u2019s not just a matter of fuel capacity\u2014but I\u2019m certain we can override the mechanism with enough authority.\u201d\nYerin punched her own fists against each other. \u201cLet\u2019s cut it open, then.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit more delicate than that, but certainly, we can try. You have the Remnant of a Sage and a Herald in tow, so we have some leverage.\u201d\n\u201cBurn \u2018em like split wood. Whatever it takes.\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try the Storm Sage first? He was quite skilled in spatial transfer when he was alive.\u201d\nYerin mentally urged the mutated dragon-man Remnant forward. It chuckled as it stepped forward, with teeth larger than the rest of its entire head. She pointed at the portal. \u201cGet it open,\u201d Yerin ordered.\nThe Remnant hissed out a laugh between its teeth, and sparks crackled around its smile. Its spiritual sense washed over the entire doorframe as it took in the device.\nZiel watched it doubtfully. \u201cIs it helping?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s looking to figure something out, but I can\u2019t be stone-certain it has the brains for that,\u201d Yerin replied.\nThe Thunder Fairy\u2019s Remnant floated up next to her. \u201cWe can hear you,\u201d the spirit said. Its voice was like snapping lightning and rushing wind.\n\u201cCan you get the door open?\u201d Yerin asked.\nThe Fairy Remnant didn\u2019t have a joint to bend at the waist, but it bobbed in a close-enough imitation of a bow. \u201cIf this door can be moved, we will move it.\u201d\n\u201cAt least they\u2019re loyal!\u201d Mercy pointed out.\nYerin could feel what was happening with these Remnants. In fact, she could feel more than she had ever wanted to.\nThe two were weaker than they remembered being. Weaker, even, than they would have been if someone other than Yerin had killed them. Her Phoenix Song had stripped them of much of their will and memories, not to mention their madra. They weren\u2019t what they should be.\nBut Remnants started as echoes of the people they had been in life, and these two had served their respective causes for centuries.\nYushi\u2019s diamond-like Remnant felt the need to out-perform. To be seen. She would put her all into her tasks, and she would either accomplish them or fail after so much effort that she could not be blamed.\nThe Sage of Calling Storms had left a Remnant dedicated to chaos. It wanted to see things break, change, and move, and was happy to follow orders that fell into those categories.\nThis was, therefore, the perfect task for them.\nThey combined their wills easily, with Yerin as an intermediary, filling the half-formed portal with power and pushing against it in complex ways Yerin couldn\u2019t understand.\nHalf of the scripts around the columns of the doorframe filled with crackling blue-and-yellow light. The swirls of sapphire in the center grew stronger.\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Yerin called.\nThere were some problems. First, they were burning themselves out like a candle. Unlike sacred artists, Remnants used up pieces of themselves as they worked. Without a source to replenish their power, like a long time soaking in aura or some other spirits to eat, they would lose anything they used here.\nIf Yerin thought they\u2019d break open the way on their own, she\u2019d use them up.", "5dfffe5d-7ee1-4b9c-8e5c-1bb78b749b4d": "It wanted to see things break, change, and move, and was happy to follow orders that fell into those categories.\nThis was, therefore, the perfect task for them.\nThey combined their wills easily, with Yerin as an intermediary, filling the half-formed portal with power and pushing against it in complex ways Yerin couldn\u2019t understand.\nHalf of the scripts around the columns of the doorframe filled with crackling blue-and-yellow light.

But it didn\u2019t seem they would manage it, so she kept them in reserve.\nShe wanted that power herself. What she could use, she would. What she couldn\u2019t, she\u2019d burn in battle.\nThe Sage\u2019s Remnant tried a little harder, but ultimately snapped off. Yushi\u2019s spirit had stopped as soon as ordered.\n\u201cThought you were burning them for firewood,\u201d the Oracle Sage said.\nYerin stepped up to the door. \u201cWill if I need to, but I think I can warm us just fine myself.\u201d\nBy sensing the process through the two bound Remnants, Yerin had gotten something of an idea of how it worked.  She thought she could force it open.\nIf she couldn\u2019t, the others would get a turn.\nThe Sage of a Thousand Eyes stopped her with a gesture. \u201cLean on your authority,\u201d she advised. \u201cYou are the apprentice of Ozmanthus Arelius.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d contend he wants me to break his door?\u201d Yerin focused her willpower on the portal, taking control of it as though it were a runaway Forger technique.\nShe pressed her will into it as she had felt her Remnants do, and she did take the Oracle Sage\u2019s advice. Yerin remembered Eithan. Training with him, sparring against him, living alongside him. She recalled him adopting her, and when he called her Yerin Arelius.\nShe remembered him doing battle in the sky.\n\u201cOpen!\u201d Yerin commanded.\nUnlike when Lindon or the other Sages did it, she didn\u2019t feel the world responding to her orders. She felt silly for having spoken out loud.\nBut her will did press against something, and that surface cracked like ice in spring. Blue light swirled more clearly inside the door, and the scripts filled almost all the way. If she pushed just a little harder, she\u2019d reach the other side, she was sure.\nShe focused her intentions, cycled her madra, and braced her feet. Just one more push\u2026\nA hand clapped onto her shoulder. The Sage of a Thousand Eyes. \u201cPerhaps if you weren\u2019t exhausted, dear,\u201d the Sage said. \u201cWe have other hands here.\u201d\nYerin released her gathered will and almost staggered under a sudden wave of dizziness. She was exhausted, despite the strength she\u2019d taken from the Sage and the Herald. In a way, she felt more substantial than ever. In another way, she was about to pitch onto her face.\nNot in any shape to fight a Dreadgod.\nNone of them were. Despair started to choke her. What if they did get the portal open? When they showed up, they would just be more people Lindon had to save.\nThe Sage had never released her, and now she gave Yerin\u2019s shoulder a squeeze. \u201cIt\u2019s not over yet. Mercy, why don\u2019t you give it a try?\u201d\nYerin expected Mercy to get flustered and ask \u201cMe?\u201d before squaring her shoulders and giving it a shot. Instead, Mercy strode smoothly over to the entrance. She looked the portal up and down and focused her will.\nTo her surprise, Yerin felt the pressure coming off Mercy. It was as though this were Malice about to give a command, not her daughter.\n\u201cAllow us through,\u201d Mercy ordered. Like Yerin\u2019s, Mercy\u2019s command didn\u2019t resonate like a Sage\u2019s would have. But it pressured the gateway nonetheless. Yerin sensed the authority of the Ashwind queen\u2019s heir.\nThe script on the pillars filled up all the way, but the blue swirls in the center were still a chaotic mess. Mercy turned from the doorway as though she\u2019d taken her own success as a matter of course.\nZiel moved forward. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll be the last one.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d the Oracle Sage said, \u201cit\u2019s best for you to stand aside.", "0cf904a9-5c72-409e-bef9-985ead09db95": "Instead, Mercy strode smoothly over to the entrance.

You\u2019re newly awakened to the Shield Icon, aren\u2019t you? The Shield has no inherent connection to spatial authority. As you gain more experience, you can stretch your Icon further, but for now\u2026why not leave it to me, all right?\u201d\nZiel\u2019s shoulders slumped as he shuffled away.\nThe Sage of a Thousand Eyes raised her hand. Globes of light formed, shaping themselves into eyes, and focused on the portal. She Forged them for twenty full seconds, well after Yerin thought she would stop, but an intangible pressure grew as each eye was added.\nOnly when they spread into a net, like a round array gathered in front of the Sage, did Yerin realize what this was. It was some kind of amplifier for the Sage\u2019s authority.\n\u201cPeace,\u201d the Oracle Sage commanded.\nThe light in both scripted pillars stopped flickering with the chaos of lightning and became smooth. The twisting field of blue in the center smoothed out and deepened. Now, instead of a swirling mess of light, it was a tunnel into deep and endless blue.\nThe Sage let out a breath as though that working had taken something from her, but Yerin held on to the sight. This was the first time she\u2019d been able to fully appreciate the skill that had gone into a Sage\u2019s command.\nThousand Eyes used her authority as deftly as Yerin\u2019s master had used his sword.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait until the transfer stabilizes,\u201d Cladia told them. \u201cOnly a few minutes now. Get what rest you can.\u201d Then she turned to Yerin and smiled. \u201cDid you see something new today?\u201d\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you advanced to Monarch?\u201d Yerin asked.\nCladia nodded and pulled a stool out of a void space, then settled into it. \u201cIn terms of skill as a Sage, I have little left to learn. My authority has reached its limit, so long as I don\u2019t advance, ascend, or bond with a new Icon. Therefore, I was tempted. With House Arelius in the situation it was\u2026\u201d\nThe Oracle Sage sighed. \u201cIf I could have advanced in the first few years after Tiberian\u2019s death, I\u2019m sure I would have. But most of my body was destroyed. By the time my spirit was stable enough to consider a Herald\u2019s advancement, Reigan Shen was no longer a threat to us.\u201d She nodded to Yerin. \u201cThanks to Eithan. And you.\u201d\nYerin gripped her sword. \u201cAdvance now, and you can pay back the favor.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as you make it sound. Akura Fury had been a Herald for so long that it took him years of preparation to put himself on the verge of advancement. For someone like me, it would take time, and there\u2019s always the chance of failure.\u201d\nCladia swept her hand down her elegant sacred artist\u2019s robes as though presenting her own appearance. \u201cThe longer you stay on one course, the harder it is to change. At this point, it\u2019s close to impossible for me to become a Monarch.\u201d\n\u201cMy mother was a Sage for many years before she advanced,\u201d Mercy pointed out.\n\u201cAlways with the intention to become a Monarch, so she was not changing direction at all. She intended not to let anything get in the way of her ambition. Much like you all.\u201d\nChanges had begun in the center of the blue-swirling portal. Now there were images flickering amidst the sapphire depths. Glimpses of the other side. Yerin leaned forward.\nThe Oracle Sage noticed. \u201cBefore you get too eager, we should discuss what we\u2019ll find on the other side.

Therefore, we shouldn\u2019t transport ourselves too close to him.\u201d\n\u201cCan you restore my Moonlight Bridge?\u201d Yerin asked.\n\u201cAs I was not involved in its creation, I\u2019m afraid I cannot. Not without effort that would render me useless, anyway.\u201d\nZiel tilted his horns to point back to the stairs, where a number of Arelius sacred artists were huddled. \u201cWhat about the rest? If you\u2019re fighting with us, who takes care of them?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to help you fight,\u201d Cladia clarified. \u201cI won\u2019t be engaging with the Weeping Dragon myself. There are Monarchs on the prowl all over Ashwind, looking for Eithan\u2019s apprentices. Who knows what they would do, if given the opportunity to attack a House Arelius banner without my protection?\u201d\nCladia looked off into the distance. \u201cI have seen glimpses myself. I cannot allow it.\u201d\nYerin felt like she could see why the Oracle Sage had seen such a stiff prediction of their future. Cladia should be as exhausted as the rest of them, but surely four tired fighters were better than three.\nThe portal was congealing slowly. Yerin could sense it, and while her heart was tightening like a bowstring, she felt that they had a few minutes left.\nShe guzzled a recovery elixir while Mercy and Ziel did the same. They wouldn\u2019t be able to restore themselves completely, not so fast, but they could at least go into the fight with cores decently refilled. More importantly, they needed whatever help the Sage could give them.\n\u201cWhat do you have that can weight the dice for us?\u201d Yerin asked.\nCladia examined the back of her own hand. \u201cFor one thing? Experience. It was the Weeping Dragon that tore apart my body almost ten years ago. If not for my own preparations and a treasure Tiberian gave me, I would have surely died.\u201d\nAll three of them tightened their focus. A Sage who had crossed swords with the Weeping Dragon was a valuable resource, even if she didn\u2019t fight at their side.\nThe Oracle Sage held up one finger. \u201cFirst, don\u2019t underestimate its skill. The Dragon acts like a rampaging monster, but it is clever. Thanks to the demise of the Slumbering Wraith and the Silent King, the Dragon has only grown stronger and more cunning. Think of it as the Wandering Titan on the outside but the Silent King on the inside.\u201d\nYerin resisted the urge to roll her eyes. \u2018Don\u2019t underestimate your opponent\u2019 was the most basic advice anyone could give.\nCladia held up a second finger. \u201cIt is skillful in navigating the future. It cannot see possible fates as well as the Silent King could, but it can cloud possibilities and dodge the predictions of others. Relying on my predictions almost cost me my life.\u201d\nThat was helpful information. Yerin couldn\u2019t see the future, but she had to assume the Dreadgod could dodge Dross\u2019 calculations as well as an oracle\u2019s prophecies.\nShe wondered if even Dross himself knew that.\nA third finger joined the first two. \u201cBeware its dragon\u2019s breath. This almost goes without saying, but you would be surprised how many people forget it. The Weeping Dragon has many more obvious abilities, but it uses them subtly to corner its prey. When it finally unleashes its breath, you will find that you have no way out.\u201d\nShe folded her hands on one another and spoke with a subtle smile. \u201cIt is the strongest offensive technique on this planet. It cannot be defended against, only evaded. If you are struck by it, you will surely die.\u201d\n\u201cIs that what happened to you?\u201d Ziel asked bluntly.\n\u201cNo. That\u2019s what happened to Northstrider.\u201d Cladia gave a pained smile at the memory.", "3680a9d5-6671-43b9-9935-7ed7bb19fce4": "She wondered if even Dross himself knew that.\nA third finger joined the first two. \u201cBeware its dragon\u2019s breath.

She\u2019d seen memories of others fighting the Weeping Dragon, had heard stories about it, but she\u2019d never spoken to anyone who had engaged it tactically like this.\n\u201cDon\u2019t get cornered,\u201d Yerin said. \u201cGive my left arm for that Moonlight Bridge back.\u201d\nWithout standing from her stool, the Oracle Sage beckoned them all over. \u201cThe timing is not ideal, but this is far from the worst possible fate. Be careful, remember what I\u2019ve told you, and keep your eyes open. That\u2019s your best chance. And now, I give you my blessing.\u201d\nShe spread her hands in front of their faces, gesturing vaguely like a street-side fortune-teller. Yerin would have been skeptical about the performance if she couldn\u2019t feel the gentle blanket of willpower settling over them and feel the intricate working of authority.\n\u201cSee as I do,\u201d said the Sage of a Thousand Eyes.\nVision spread around Yerin like blinders had been removed from her eyes.\nIt wasn\u2019t exactly like the Arelius bloodline ability, but it resembled what Eithan had always described: seeing everything at once.\nYerin had always imagined this gift as overwhelming. Even Eithan had mentioned having to train as a child to avoid being drowned in the extra information. And she knew he experienced senses other than sight.\nBut she found this blessing easy to process. Maybe it was because she was a Herald, but she had no trouble adjusting. Indeed, she stretched out the web of vision and found that she could see House Arelius members patching each other up even the better part of a mile away.\n\u201cAmazing,\u201d Mercy breathed. \u201cI can see so much! How can we adjust to it so quickly?\u201d\nThe Sage sagged against the wall, breathing heavily. \u201cI have\u2026given sight to you\u2026according to your ability to receive it. You won\u2019t be overwhelmed, but it will fade by the end of the day. Go. Your friend\u2019s mind-spirit will know how best to use it.\u201d\nYerin whipped around to face the doorway. The portal was opening.\nCladia had closed her eyes and was still breathing hard, but a grin slashed across her tired face that made her look like Eithan. \u201cAnd when you see Eithan again\u2026tell him he should have said good-bye.\u201d\nWhen the portal opened, Yerin was the first one through.", "9f5b8e1b-e965-4181-aa6b-3b689bb8e54a": "18\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the Eight-Man Empire vanished, Lindon clashed against the Weeping Dragon with Orthos and Little Blue behind him.\nThe air was thick with rain whipped around by hurricane winds, and lightning serpents flashed down from the clouds to streak toward them. Orthos crushed Striker techniques in his hands, while Blue wiped them out by the dozen with an Empty Palm the size of her new human body.\nThey were keeping the nuisances away from Lindon while he dealt with the real problem.\nA claw large enough to scoop out villages flashed at Lindon, who met it with black dragon\u2019s breath. The beam was thicker than Lindon\u2019s leg and pure black, empowered by the Void Icon.\nThe Dragon\u2019s claw was knocked back, but that was only one of its attacks.\nLindon blasted the second claw away as well, but the Dragon\u2019s jaws snapped down around him. He flew out, dodging the fangs and the crackling lightning around them.\nAs Lindon flew by the dragon\u2019s lip, he gripped a handful of scales and began to Consume.\nAt the same instant, lightning snaked out from the Dreadgod and fed on him in turn.\nLindon was the one to break it off. He couldn\u2019t tell who had gotten more from that exchange, but his spirit ached. Now that his madra channels ran through his physical body, that was even more painful than it had been.\nClaws flashed again, and he kicked off with the Burning Cloak to intercept before Orthos was hit. Every attack the Weeping Dragon made, Lindon was there to block.\nBut that was all he could do.\n[We can definitely keep this up! He will, eventually, kill us at this pace. And I am just as tired as I was before. But we will live for at least a few more glorious minutes!]\nOrthos and Little Blue were too weak.\nEven with their advancement, it was the best a new Sage and Herald could do just to survive on a Dreadgod battlefield. There were only two factors that allowed them to participate in the fight.\nFirst, Dross was commanding them. He\u2019d tell them where to position and when to strike, and thus, the trio fought with perfect coordination.\nSecond, they could pull power from Lindon.\nLittle Blue\u2019s techniques were magnified by Lindon\u2019s madra, now that she could withstand that much power, and Orthos shot dragon\u2019s breath that had a touch of the Void and Dragon Icons. Without their bond to him, they would have had to use all their powers to flee.\nBut Lindon\u2019s cores were deep. Not endless. And he could only channel so much madra at one time.\n[They\u2019re helping a little,] Dross said. [Enough to keep them here. But time is not on our side.]\nIn every exchange with the Weeping Dragon, Lindon came up short.\nPowerful in madra and authority Lindon might have been, but the Weeping Dragon\u2019s body was measured in miles. Every physical blow cost too much for Lindon to defend, and he had to pump his techniques with all the power he could scrape up to match the Dragon.\nThe Void Icon whispered around him, clouding his future, as Emriss had taught him. He couldn\u2019t sense the future well, but this was like veiling himself in Fate.\nHe couldn\u2019t sense it, but Dross could.\n[It\u2019s not working. He\u2019s not changing what he does. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s reading our future at all; I think he\u2019s just hitting us with brute force. To be fair, it\u2019s working.]\nThough, if the Dragon really wasn\u2019t manipulating or predicting them, they should be able to create an opening.\nLindon weakened the Dreadgod\u2019s blow with an Empty Palm before catching the gigantic claw with the strength of the Soul Cloak. But he was still sent flying through the storm, with the miles-long sapphire Dragon swimming after him.\nStorm aura tore at him, ripping away his flight, hammering him with lightning bolts. He took the hits and slashed back with dragon\u2019s breath, striking the Weeping Dragon across the belly. That wasn\u2019t a decisive injury on the Dreadgod, but it at least scored a flinch and a roar of pain.\nLindon crashed down onto its head with a heavy blow worthy of Northstrider, and the Weeping Dragon cracked the land open with its tail and sent storm madra shooting up Lindon\u2019s feet until he had to leap off.\nWhile Lindon was carrying the most weight, Orthos and Little Blue were still working hard. The Dreadgod noticed, twisting to them.\nThat was an opening.\nLindon withdrew the Silent King Bow, which erupted into a white ring over his head.", "24ead137-2b1e-48f9-acaf-cdf95a20439d": "But he was still sent flying through the storm, with the miles-long sapphire Dragon swimming after him.\nStorm aura tore at him, ripping away his flight, hammering him with lightning bolts.

The Dreadgod noticed, twisting to them.\nThat was an opening.\nLindon withdrew the Silent King Bow, which erupted into a white ring over his head. The Weeping Dragon reacted instantly, flashing back toward Lindon, but he already had a Penance arrow nocked.\nWeakened as he was, just pulling the string back took everything Lindon had. Every muscle in his body strained, and he focused his entire being on the arrow.\nBut this was the shot.\nHe loosed the arrow, aiming for the Dragon\u2019s eye.\nThe Dreadgod ducked and tried to scurry out of the way, but Penance was not a simple arrow. It sought its prey.\nWhile the arrow didn\u2019t land where Lindon intended, it did not miss.\nThe deadly missile pierced the Weeping Dragon in the side of the neck and emerged from the other side almost immediately. Blood sprayed across the landscape in a waterfall, and the Dreadgod let out a scream.\nThe entire storm flashed with lightning at the sound.\nLittle Blue, Orthos, and even Dross shuddered in place. They froze for an instant, spirits instinctively shrinking away from the willpower and authority in the dragon\u2019s roar. Only Lindon remained focused.\nHis vision blurred and his spirit burned, but he summoned the arrow back. He needed one more attack like that. If he could just force out one more\u2026\nThe Penance arrow vanished from where it had landed.\nBut it didn\u2019t reappear in Lindon\u2019s hand.\n\u201cNo!\u201d the Weeping Dragon commanded. Its voice rang with thunder.\nIf he were at his peak, Lindon thought he could have contested that working. He had greater authority over the arrow as the Soulsmith who had assembled it and the apprentice of the Soulsmith who had created the arrowhead in the first place.\nBut he\u2019d faced down Monarchs without rest all day. It was all he could do to keep the Silent King Bow from overwhelming his mind and spirit.\nTherefore, the Weeping Dragon\u2019s command tore the arrow away in mid-transit.\nInside a miniature storm, the black-and-white arrow appeared in the center of the Dreadgod\u2019s claw. It was so small that it was barely visible against the Weeping Dragon\u2019s vast limb, like a single grain of sand in a man\u2019s palm.\nThe Dragon crushed the arrow, and Lindon felt its true destruction.\nTwo left.\nLittle Blue and Orthos struck the Dragon as it was focused on the arrow, so an Empty Palm and a massive dragon\u2019s breath both landed on the Dreadgod\u2019s seemingly endless length.\nBoth attacks landed. Lindon could feel them. But the Weeping Dragon\u2019s will still crashed down on Lindon, victorious and arrogant, looking down on him.\nDross didn\u2019t say anything, but he layered a prediction on the future. At this rate, they were stalling until their deaths. The Dragon would grind them down, and he wouldn\u2019t let them flee through space.\nIf all four of them stuck together, they would last longer. Maybe long enough for reinforcements to arrive. The only advantage they had was that the Weeping Dragon wouldn\u2019t cooperate with their enemies; if Reigan Shen or Malice showed up, it would become a three-way battle.\nIf no one came in time, they would all die.\nLindon could send Orthos and Little Blue away, but if they left, he and Dross wouldn\u2019t last long.\n[If we\u2019re going to send them away, it\u2019s got to be fast. We have a window that is sliiiiiding closed.]\nI thought we could do it, Lindon thought.\nHe wasn\u2019t talking about sending Orthos and Little Blue away, but he didn\u2019t need to clarify. Dross could read his mind.\nLindon meant the pocket world. Their plan. \u201cWhen we come out of here, the Dragon will run from us.\u201d He\u2019d thought they could do it.\nSo arrogant.\n[We always knew it was arrogant, didn\u2019t we?

He\u2019d be fine.\nLittle Blue was pursued through the sky by a swarm of lightning-dragons, wiping them out a handful at a time.\nLindon was separated, Consuming a Striker technique from the Dragon and sending it back. Even without Dross\u2019 predictions, he could see the rest of the fight playing out. He could feel himself being backed into a corner.\nThe Dragon could feel it too. Lindon could taste it in the Dreadgod\u2019s thoughts when he used Consume. The Weeping Dragon was enjoying this. It was letting off steam.\nThey all sensed the new powers at the same time.\nLindon\u2019s spiritual sense lashed out to the east together with the Dragon\u2019s. Their battle had carried them all over the western Blackflame Empire, but these new presences were coming from the direction of Blackflame City.\nYerin. Mercy. Ziel.\nThey were on the way.\nHe could feel the Weeping Dragon\u2019s disdain, but the Dreadgod still sent a storm billowing in their direction to slow them down. The next action Dross predicted was the Weeping Dragon putting extra pressure on Lindon, because no matter how much the Dreadgod looked down on the newcomers, he would still end the fight before they arrived.\nLindon pushed out the Hollow Domain, which covered the terrain from ground to sky and miles in every direction. He had to hold off the pressure until Yerin and the others arrived.\nDross showed the Dragon moving toward Lindon.\nBut in reality, the Dragon moved back.\n[No, wait! Lindon, hit him! Orthos, where are you?]\nOrthos responded to the call with black dragon\u2019s breath, but he was a second late. His technique missed, and the Weeping Dragon was already gathering power between its jaws.\nDragon\u2019s breath. On a level incomparable to anything Lindon had ever seen before.\nThe storm swirled into the Weeping Dragon\u2019s mouth as it devoured aura from miles around. Serpents of living lightning returned, gladly throwing themselves into the newborn star of blue-and-yellow madra. They carried stolen power with them, madra they\u2019d taken from the spirits of those they\u2019d consumed.\nThe technique was just beginning. Lindon could stop it.\nLindon was aware of all his possible actions, but Dross played them out anyway.\nIn the first vision, Lindon saw himself lunge toward the Dragon to stop the dragon\u2019s breath. The incomplete Striker technique struck him head-on, and Lindon was blasted from the sky. The Dreadgod turned to Orthos and Little Blue.\nAll of them were eaten before Yerin or the others arrived.\nIn the second vision, Lindon clawed open the air and tried to flee. The Dreadgod shut down his transportation and hit him anyway.\nIn the third, Lindon flew to the side and drew away the Dragon\u2019s attention. In that case, the Dreadgod had his pick of targets. Whoever landed in his sights died.\n[We\u2019re cornered, aren\u2019t we? This is a corner.]\nWe still have options.\n[Not good ones! I want good options! I don\u2019t like gambling with our lives!]\nNeither did Lindon. He preferred stacking the deck.\nThough he found himself gambling with his own life at stake disturbingly often. When he ascended from Cradle, he\u2019d put an end to that.\nLindon selected his plan. He gripped the Silent King Bow and fitted a second Penance arrow to the string, then he leaped up through the air over the Weeping Dragon\u2019s head.", "3681bca8-9c9f-42b7-bb69-f21ec8f9e70d": "The Dreadgod shut down his transportation and hit him anyway.\nIn the third, Lindon flew to the side and drew away the Dragon\u2019s attention.

He gripped the Silent King Bow and fitted a second Penance arrow to the string, then he leaped up through the air over the Weeping Dragon\u2019s head.\nIf he did use the arrow, it would be the last thing he did in the fight. Releasing the arrow would push his mind, body, and spirit to the limit. If it didn\u2019t kill him, he certainly wouldn\u2019t be in the shape to continue fighting.\nBut the Weeping Dragon was in the same position. One more blow from Penance was all it could take.\nLindon had no intention of loosing the arrow. He was posing a threat the Dreadgod couldn\u2019t ignore. In all of Dross\u2019 projections, the Weeping Dragon followed Lindon.\nThat was where the risk came in. Roughly six out of ten times, the Dreadgod would hit Lindon with the half-completed technique. In the other four cases, Lindon dodged it.\nHe was betting on his own ability. At the very least, the Dreadgod wouldn\u2019t be targeting his friends.\nOr that was how it was supposed to be.\n[That\u2019s\u2026Oh no. He got me.]\nThe Weeping Dragon didn\u2019t follow Lindon for a second. It tracked the others.\nThe storm had reached Yerin, and she, Mercy, and Ziel were battling their way through a hostile storm and a flight of lightning-dragons. The Weeping Dragon\u2019s attention was on them. His techniques would hold them in place, and the will of the Dreadgod would ensure they didn\u2019t escape through the Way.\nLindon had left them unprotected.\nAnd Dross hadn\u2019t seen it coming.\nThe world paused again, and now Dross saw possibilities he hadn\u2019t before. They had been shrouded. By storm clouds.\nThe authority of the Weeping Dragon.\nIt had done the same thing Lindon had, but Lindon and Dross had been too inexperienced to notice. The Dreadgod had hidden threads of Fate. Shrouded them behind clouds.\nNow it was pulling away those clouds, showing entire branches of possibility in which the Dragon ignored Lindon\u2019s threat and targeted the others.\nThe final piece of the puzzle slid into place in Lindon\u2019s mind.\nUnlike the other Dreadgods, the Weeping Dragon remembered its original life. It thought of itself as a superior being, greater even than its siblings. A dragon\u2019s pride would not bend.\nIf it died while striking a fatal blow on its enemy, it would go to its grave with head held high.\nThere was no manipulating a dragon. No negotiation. You moved as it decreed, or you died.\n[I didn\u2019t see it,] Dross said. He sounded lost. [I\u2019m\u2026I\u2019m sorry.]\nLindon dropped the bow.\nEven if he shot the Dragon with Penance, that would only kill it. The attack wouldn\u2019t stop. That was what the Dreadgod was counting on.\nThe Void Icon ate into Lindon\u2019s thoughts, leaving him cold. There were no options left to him. The Dragon Descends had enough power to move the Dreadgod, but the technique required fire aura, and they were in the heart of a rainstorm.

It all went into the technique.\nIt was perhaps the most delicate and complex use of the sacred arts Lindon had ever performed, but it all took only a blink. In an instant, Lindon was surrounded by a strange black-and-white fire.\nThe world warped around him from his very presence.\nForce madra gave him a platform, and he kicked off. As he shot down to the ground, space cracked in the wake of his flight.\nLindon slammed into the ground, and the impact would be enough to create a new crater. If there had been a mountain beneath him, it would have been reduced to pebbles.\nBut none of that had happened yet. The world moved so slowly it was as if Dross was making a prediction. Everything seemed still.\nLindon kicked off again, aiming for the underside of the Dreadgod\u2019s jaw.\nHe hit the bottom of the Weeping Dragon\u2019s head like an erupting volcano. Bones bigger than ships cracked.\nThe Dragon still released its breath.\nA column of gold-and-sapphire energy split the air. It resembled solid matter, like the Dreadgod had Forged glowing steel instead of releasing a Striker technique.\nThe Dragon\u2019s breath slashed across the sky. The storm clouds were split in half.\nToo high to threaten the others.\nStill, the Weeping Dragon forced its head down. While it still had the technique, it was trying to bring it down on them like a sword.\nLindon had nothing to brace against. He gathered wind and force aura beneath him to push him upward, but that shouldn\u2019t have been enough. A platform of aura was too flimsy to hold against a Dreadgod.\nHe shoved against the Weeping Dragon anyway. The Dragon Icon gave him strength that defied the rules of the world.\nWith both hands, Lindon pushed against a sky of blue scales. Every piece of him was burning away to fuel strength that, for at least a moment, dwarfed the Monarchs.\nGradually, the Dreadgod\u2019s head was forced up.\nThe Dragon\u2019s breath slashed across the sky again, until it finally erupted straight up. Madra gushed into the sky, and suddenly Lindon had nothing to push against.\nHe flew up, turning to keep his enemy in view. He had to strike again. He couldn\u2019t keep this Enforcer technique up for much longer, so before it wore off\u2026\nLindon coughed up blood.\n[I think we took it a little too far this time,] Dross said.\nBlood trailed from his eyes.

Without discussion, the three of them buckled down to defend. They landed on the ground, and Ziel stood in front with his large, steel shield braced. He clung to the Shield Icon as well, mustering all the willpower he could focus.\nYerin lay a hand on his shoulder and joined her will to his, reinforcing his defense. The two Remnants following her around generated a barrier of lightning around them and pushed against the storm aura in the air.\nMercy was covered head-to-toe in amethyst armor, and she Forged a web of dark madra around them. He suspected that wouldn\u2019t do anything to stop the Weeping Dragon\u2019s breath, but maybe she was setting something up.\nThey continued layering their defenses. Ziel spun emerald runes into a circle around them with the Path of the Dawn Oath. Further and further he went, adding several concentric circles. Two of the script-circles resisted madra, one resisted physical force, and he even quickly improvised one that resisted storm aura specifically.\nAs Ziel watched the shining star of madra gathering in the Dreadgod\u2019s mouth, he tried to convince himself that this would be enough. He was the perfect person to stand in front of the others. He was the Shield Sage, now. He had a Path suited for defense.\nHe was a wall that wouldn\u2019t buckle.\nThen the Weeping Dragon unleashed its breath, and he saw how wrong he\u2019d been.\nA solid cylinder of light split the sky in half, tearing open the storm clouds. The pressure from the technique alone crushed his script-circles, stripped away the authority of his Icon, and shoved him back a dozen paces.\nTrees and grass were stripped away as far as Ziel could see. The breath hadn\u2019t even hit. This was just the wind from its passing.\nHe\u2019d seen Monarchs and Dreadgods attack, but this was a technique on a different level.\nYerin planted her feet and cycled all her madra to resist, her red lock of hair flapping in the wind. She gritted her teeth and glared up at the technique over them, but she didn\u2019t waste any power attacking it. Everything was going toward keeping her upright.\nMercy was braced against the stone ground, fingers and toes dug in to keep herself from blowing backwards. She was still covered in her bloodline armor, and she tried to lash herself to the ground with Strings of Shadow, but the techniques were destroyed the instant she tried to Forge them.\nThis overwhelming, impossible spiritual pressure was just the wake of the Dragon\u2019s breath. Ziel couldn\u2019t imagine how it had missed, and his spiritual sense was blinded. Either the Dreadgod had aimed at something else, or Lindon had done something.\nThen the technique began to lower, like the sword of an executioner.\nZiel lifted his shield. It was like holding up a leaf against a wildfire, but he had to do something.\nThis was the third time his death had descended on him from the sky.\nLong ago, the Weeping Dragon had attacked the Dawnwing Sect. A malicious living thunderstorm had stretched from horizon to horizon. At the end of his fight with the Sage of Calling Storms, Ziel had looked into the flashing lightning and known it would be his death.\nThen, not so long ago, the sky had turned black.

Everything with the slightest spiritual sense in all of Cradle felt the end had come. If Eithan hadn\u2019t risen to defend them, the entire world would have died. Once again, Ziel had been certain he would die.\nNow, the Weeping Dragon was back. And there was another force from the sky that Ziel couldn\u2019t affect at all.\nSomething in him snapped.\nHe was already braced with his Enforcer technique, the Stone Anchor, which allowed him to keep his feet. If barely.\nZiel lowered his shield and shouted up into the dragon\u2019s breath.\n\u201cCOME ON!\u201d he shouted. \u201cTRY IT! HIT ME!\u201d\nThe wind snatched away the sound. Even he didn\u2019t hear his own words.\nBut fear had left him. It was replaced by anger.\nHow many times could he survive so-called \u2018inevitable\u2019 death before it stopped scaring him? He had given up too many times. He wasn\u2019t doing it again.\nThe Dragon\u2019s breath lifted, slowly sliding upward.\nFor a second, pure astonishment cut through his anger. Had the Dreadgod heard him? Had his desperate shout actually done something?\nThe line of light sliced upward, back through the sky. It picked up speed as it moved, revealing the Dreadgod\u2019s warped sky. Each Dreadgod affected the aura such that the sky changed colors when they were around, but it was rare to ever see the Weeping Dragon\u2019s, thanks to the dark clouds it dragged around everywhere.\nThis one was a bright, eye-searing electric blue that no one could mistake for a natural color.\nIts breath cut through that blue at a jagged angle, as though the Weeping Dragon were spraying its breath randomly.\nIn its flailing, the technique passed over the moon.\nIn less than a second, there was a visible trench gouged into the gray-white surface of the moon. Rock and dust sprayed out to the sides like the waves of an ocean.\nIt looked like someone had taken a dagger and scraped a line across the moon.\nThe Weeping Dragon vomited the rest of its breath straight up into the sky, and finally Ziel could sense what had happened.\nLindon was a dense core of black-and-white power beneath the dragon\u2019s head. He hovered there, the center of a gravity so intense that he seemed more real even than the Dreadgod.\nJudging from Lindon\u2019s position, Ziel could tell what had happened. He\u2019d forced the Weeping Dragon\u2019s breath up and into the sky.\nWithout him, they\u2019d be dead.\nHis was an awe-inspiring presence, as Lindon flew upward and moved to launch another attack against the Weeping Dragon. This was the sort of feat that would be legendary even for a Monarch, and Ziel prepared to witness the young man kill a second Dreadgod.\nLike a vanishing candle-flame, Lindon\u2019s power flickered out.\nIt went from such an overwhelming force to nothing so quickly that it couldn\u2019t have been intentional. Or healthy.\nThen Lindon plummeted from the sky.\nThe ground was shaking for miles around as the Weeping Dragon thrashed around on the landscape like a dying snake, but it wasn\u2019t dead. Ziel felt nothing but a furious will from the Dreadgod.\nAnd from himself.\nA ring of green runes sprang up around him, made from what madra he\u2019d managed to recover. Despite the burden it placed on his Divine Treasure, he forced out a ring of silver runes as well. Ziel launched himself toward the Weeping Dragon, and Mercy followed a second later. Yerin had shot off on her own already, but he overtook her as he flew through the air under the influence of his scripts.\nLindon had given them a chance.\nNow he was going to kill a Dreadgod.", "12e25364-7b3d-4d05-9d0f-66950297f3b8": "19\n\n\n\n\n\nOrthos coughed out smoke and shoved a chunk of stone off of him with one hand.\nHand. He still wasn\u2019t used to having one of those. A shell would have been much more useful.\nThe ground pitched around him like the deck of a sinking ship, and he was deafened by the cries of the Weeping Dragon. A loop of blue scales passed over them as the Dreadgod thrashed, covering them in shadow.\nOrthos sensed Blue nearby and looked to her, only to see her punching her way out of the side of a cliff. Stone sprayed out and she stumbled after it, blue hair frizzy. She panted and looked around with wild eyes, but when she saw Orthos, she nodded.\nThey could both feel Lindon, and it wasn\u2019t what they did feel that concerned them. It was what they couldn\u2019t feel.\nHis cores were completely empty, and even the sense of his presence felt weak. He was unconscious, not dead\u2014Orthos wasn\u2019t sure Lindon could truly die, now that he was bound to the Dreadgods\u2014but in every other respect he might as well have been killed.\nJust as concerning, Dross had vanished from their heads.\n\u201cDo you have it?\u201d Orthos asked.\nLittle Blue withdrew the tank from her soulspace. It was made entirely from spiritual components, so it could be stored inside her spirit, but Orthos worried that being inside a soulspace would affect the delicate purple orbs floating within the tank.\nBut they felt fine to his spiritual sense, so he opened one of his human hands. With its fingers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d he said firmly.\nHe expected her to argue, but she had already withdrawn one for him and one for herself. He caught it, and the madra felt squishy and insubstantial at the same time, as dream spirits often did.\nOrthos examined it thoroughly with his spiritual sense. He\u2019d wanted to do this with Dross\u2019 guidance. It would probably be best to have a Soulsmith insert this into his soul, but they had no time for that.\nIf his spirit broke this down for madra or dream essence, the entire project would be wasted. Lindon had used materials from the Silent King to create these, not to mention irreplaceable fuel for the time-warping Grand Oath Array. Even in the heart of an apocalyptic battle, this deserved thought.\nLittle Blue swallowed the orb whole.\n\u201cDon\u2019t break it!\u201d Orthos shouted. \u201cControl it carefully!\u201d\nFrom her wide-eyed look and the way she hurriedly took control of her internal madra, he saw that she hadn\u2019t intended to control the process at all. She was just going to see what happened.\nThe earth trembled around them, beneath the Weeping Dragon, as Orthos coached her to move the featureless dream-spirit through her soul. She had incredible madra control, as a Herald and a spirit of pure madra, but Orthos had many times her experience and had even worked with Lindon more directly.\nOnce they had the dream-spirit in place, Orthos let out a relieved breath. \u201cThat\u2019s good. You did well. Now, let\u2019s get these to the others. You\u2019ll have to help them.\u201d\nShe tugged the edge of his sleeve and made a questioning sound.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t hurry it along. It takes as long as it takes. Without Dross here, it might not\u2014\u201d\n[Aaaahhh!] Dross screamed. He spun out from behind Little Blue\u2019s neck, holding one tendril to his forehead. [How did I get here? Where\u2019s Lindon?]\nOrthos\u2019 hand tightened involuntarily on the squishy purple orb in his palm. It was that easy. He should have swallowed the thing himself.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the original Dross,\u201d Orthos explained. Dross had prepared them for this.\n[Yeah, I\u2019m a copy. I get it. It\u2019s not the existential crisis for me that you\u2019d think.] Dross looked up at the Weeping Dragon and flinched, then shot over to Orthos. [What are you standing around for, are you not aware that we could die at any second? Pop yours in!]\nOrthos nodded and opened his mouth, bringing up his own Dross copy to swallow it.\n[No, no, stop! What are you doing?] He spun back to Little Blue. [Is that what you did?]\n\u201cMmm-hmm!\u201d She made a triumphant face.\n[Don\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t ever do that. Give it to me. Give me to me right now.]\nOrthos handed over the purple ball, which Dross grabbed and carried around to the back of Orthos\u2019 head.", "c765f155-6206-4144-99ba-678b73ce0537": "Dross had prepared them for this.\n[Yeah, I\u2019m a copy.

There came a sharp pinprick of pain in Orthos\u2019 spirit.\nThen his senses opened up.\nIt was as though he hadn\u2019t been using his eyes correctly before. Although he supposed that, technically, these human eyes were new. The world was cleaner, sharper. His thoughts moved more quickly.\nAnother Dross spun out from his spirit, and this time Orthos could feel him. Not in the same way he had always sensed Dross, nor even in the indirect way that he felt Lindon\u2019s emotions. He and Dross were connected now.\n[That\u2019s it! Process complete!] the new Dross said.\n[Let\u2019s go to the others now!] said the first.\n[Why are we waiting around? Is it \u2018wait to die\u2019 time and no one told me?]\n[You can just start walking and we\u2019ll take it from there.]\nOrthos began to run, and Little Blue kept up with him. She made a confused sound, which he interpreted easily. It echoed his own feelings.\n\u201cHow are we supposed to tell you apart?\u201d he asked. He could sense his own connection to one Dross, but if everyone had one, it would be many times more confusing even than dealing with Yerin and Ruby had been.\n[No need,] said his Dross.\n[We\u2019re the same,] said Blue\u2019s Dross. [Think of it as me projecting myself into many bodies. I\u2019m just doing it more efficiently, and now Lindon doesn\u2019t have to be around for you to benefit from my infinite wisdom.]\n[We were going to make blank mind-spirits for all of you, which would then grow into your own individual partners, but that would take\u2026]\n[We\u2019re not sure. A long time. Instead, we started with a copy of me, so it\u2019s useful immediately!]\n[And here\u2019s a bonus: when we develop our own individual personalities, they\u2019ll all be based on mine!]\nBlue\u2019s Dross drifted in front of Orthos\u2019 face. [I can sense you don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bonus. I can\u2019t even read your mind, but I can tell.]\nHis own Dross crossed a second later. [I can read your mind, and I can sense it too.]\nOrthos met the purple eye. \u201cThis is a thousand times better than when you spoke in death poetry.\u201d\nBoth Drosses shuddered.\n[Forget that. Erase it from your mind.]\n[No, don\u2019t bother, I\u2019ll do it.]\nOrthos was going to retort, but he felt something in his mind speed up. The world around him seemed to slow.\n[Incoming!] Dross called. [Throw me!]\nHe was talking to Little Blue, who already had a copy of Dross in her hand. Orthos pulled one out of the tank as well.\nHe could see the trajectory he needed and knew exactly how hard to throw it.

This was another weapon.\nAnd a friend.\n[Into the back of your neck!] Dross sent to her. She felt the exact spot warm up.\nMalice\u2019s instincts, absorbed from the Book of Eternal Night, warned Mercy against this. She was attaching a mind-spirit to her soul permanently. This should not only be done with careful surgery, but allowing another independent will to inhabit her body was inviting a parasite. She should never do this without clipping its independence.\nMercy ignored her mother\u2019s instincts and went with her own. She slid Dross into place.\nSeconds later, her mind and senses opened up.\n[Wow, I like it in here!] Dross said from inside her mind. [That\u2019s a top-quality human vessel you have. Lindon should have been born to a Monarch.]\nHi, Dross! Mercy thought, hoping he could hear the message. Welcome!\n[You\u2019re even nicer to me than he\u2014AAAHHH it\u2019s a Dreadgod! Right, timing! Yes! Are you ready?]\nHere, Malice\u2019s instincts served her well. Her will sharpened like an arrow as she pointed at the Weeping Dragon.\nCan we kill that?\n[That depends on you. Do you see that bow?]\nThanks to the sight loaned by the Oracle Sage, she did. A purple light highlighted the target in her vision, and she shot toward it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[You are a lot angrier than I realized you were,] Dross observed. [It just goes to show that you never really know someone until you\u2019ve nested inside their memories.]\nHelp me kill it, Ziel thought.\nThe Weeping Dragon was ruining the entire visible landscape with its body, but he could feel its will gathering. Storm clouds poured out of nowhere as the aura was agitated, and rain began to fall once again.\n[We\u2019re going to kill it. Well\u2026I said that with a lot of confidence, but without Lindon waking up, I\u2019m\u2014no offense, but I\u2019m not working with top-quality tools here. Now, listen, I can feel that you have a lot of issues to work out, but this isn\u2019t Ziel\u2019s time to shine, all right? You\u2019re going to be running interference and support.]\nWhatever gets it dead.\nZiel didn\u2019t need the credit. He didn\u2019t need to be the one to deal the final blow.\nHe would do whatever it took to see the Weeping Dragon dead.\n[That\u2019s the spirit! Now, get ready, because we\u2019re starting in one second.]\nZiel had been ready for years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nMore than angry, Yerin felt\u2026arrogant, she guessed.\nShe had sentenced the Dreadgod to die. Now was the time to execute.\n[That would be Eithan\u2019s influence on you,] her Dross pointed out. [Or\u2026Ozriel\u2019s. Ozmanthus\u2019. Whichever. Using his techniques won\u2019t hurt you, probably, but they might change you.]\nYerin was listening with one ear, so to speak. She hurtled across the ground toward the Weeping Dragon like a silver-and-red comet. The Dreadgod was drawing itself together, and this was a creature that had just left a scar on the moon.\nShe needed to hit it now, if at all.\n[More importantly, why am I red?] Dross asked.\nHer new spirit looked and felt like Dross in every way. Except he was red.\nHold a second, I\u2019ll ask my mind-spirit, she responded.\n[Yes, all right, I should know, but I can only guess.", "9b29c164-5e05-4d28-a471-bfd9b9c7798d": "Now was the time to execute.\n[That would be Eithan\u2019s influence on you,] her Dross pointed out.

I have synergized with the matrix of mind enhancements that are already here. Maybe that accelerated my development. Or maybe you like the color red so much that it spilled over me too.]\nThe Weeping Dragon\u2019s eyes focused, and she could feel the rage behind them. They landed on her, and the storm instantly clawed at her with furious wind and lightning.\nYerin\u2019s stability in midair was taken away as the Dreadgod took over all the wind aura in the area, but she took a stance even as she fell. She brought her sword back and slipped into the mentality of the Reaper.\nAt the moment, it was easier than ever. She had a target to kill.\n[Here\u2019s an example of how useful I can be!] Dross said brightly. [You remember that old, dull memory you\u2019ve been using for inspiration? I\u2019ve cleaned that up for you!]\nThe image of Eithan in black armor shone in her mind. Clearer than she\u2019d actually seen it. She wondered if Dross had taken Lindon\u2019s memory and put it together with hers.\n[That\u2019s exactly what I did. And I added a bit of my own in there. I\u2019ve also seen a lot more of Ozmanthus\u2019 memories than you have, so I\u2019ll throw in a little taste of his mentality.]\nYerin\u2019s desire to kill the Weeping Dragon sharpened as though honed on a whetstone. She could feel Ozmanthus\u2019 lethal will inside her, conveyed from Dross\u2019 memories. When he wanted to kill, that desire was honed to a perfect edge.\nThe arrogance she had been feeling, the position of an executioner, suddenly fit. All her powers, her mind, and her stance were in unity. Inside and outside.\nSomething echoed, deeper than physical reality, as she swung her sword in a slash. The Reaper\u2019s Sword.\nFor the brief instant she unleashed the technique, the world turned black-and-white.\nThe Weeping Dragon\u2019s claw flashed into place, trailing lightning, and clashed with the madra in her slash. Only her madra was pushing against the Dreadgod\u2019s claw, not her sword itself, but she still put the full power of her physical body against it.\nShe should have been launched a hundred miles away, but she stood her ground in midair. She even stopped falling.\nThen the force overwhelmed her and she did fly back. So did the upper body of the Weeping Dragon.\nSoon enough, it stopped itself and so did she. In the air.\nYerin wasn\u2019t manipulating the wind aura around her. She floated with nothing but her will.\n[Great job! Now let\u2019s stay alive until we can try again.]\nLightning crashed down around her. Ruler, Striker, and Forger techniques colliding in an implosion of thunder.\nHer twin Remnants covered for her. The spirits of two of the greatest storm artists in the world kept the Weeping Dragon from searing Yerin like a steak.\n\u201cI have defied the great one!\u201d the Storm Sage\u2019s Remnant whispered, and its laughter was the crackle of lightning and the snap of thunder. \u201cMy defiance is my tribute!\u201d\nYushi\u2019s spirit was more cooperative. \u201cWe will cover you until we break.\u201d\nThey were less than they had been in life.

Even as unbelievably powerful as he had become, it was easier to believe that the Bow was controlling him.\nIt whispered to her, promising anything. She could scarcely trust her own thoughts.\nWithout her small understanding of the Bow Icon and the support of her seventh page, she wasn\u2019t sure she could have even picked up the white-striped bow at all. Most of that authority wasn\u2019t even hers; it was borrowed from what her mother had left in the Book of Eternal Night. And from Suu.\n[Don\u2019t worry!] Dross encouraged her. [The Bow wants the same thing we do. It wants to be used. Well, don\u2019t worry about that. There\u2019s plenty else to worry about.]\nShe let him draw her attention upward, to the Weeping Dragon, who was looking away from Yerin and toward Mercy. Its pained rage and wounded pride filled the air, choking her.\nIn that sense, it was a good thing she was holding a Dreadgod weapon. Instinctively, the Silent King Bow rose to the challenge, mentally roaring back at its brother and taking the pressure off her.\nOf course, she then had to pick up the arrow.\nOne Penance arrow had fallen at her feet. She touched it, and death flashed through her body like dark lightning. Not pain; death. A cold shiver that made her certain she would die in seconds just from touching the arrow.\n[Lindon crafted the bow and arrows for you to use when you were ready. You can establish authority over them long enough for a shot, it\u2019s just\u2026well, you\u2019re not quite ready. We don\u2019t have any time left, so you have to do it anyway. This will be hard.]\nMercy firmed up her concentration, letting her mother\u2019s willpower bleed out from the Book\u2019s seventh page and carry her. The Weeping Dragon was a threat to her and her family, and she hated it. She was going to erase it from the universe. Even its name would be forgotten, swallowed by shadow and obliterated.\nThat much allowed her to pick up the arrow and fit it to the string. That hatred synergized well with the arrow\u2019s lethal purpose and the Silent King\u2019s anger. She would be able to get a shot off, she knew.\nBut she hesitated.\nDross cried out to someone else, and Orthos, Little Blue, and Ziel all unleashed techniques to block the Weeping Dragon. The Dreadgod\u2019s wave of lightning could have collapsed Moongrave\u2019s wall, but the three managed to turn it aside before it reached Mercy.\nShe stood, wrestling with her own will.\nThat hatred she felt before wasn\u2019t just from Malice. That was malice itself.\nI am not Malice. I am Mercy.\nForcibly, she changed the nature of her willpower. She changed her own intentions.\nTo the arrow, she silently whispered, This is a necessary death. We\u2019re cutting out a cancer.\nTo the bow, she said, We are the ruler, so let\u2019s defend our subjects.\nTo herself, she said, This isn\u2019t an act of malice. It\u2019s an act of mercy.\nThough it took only an instant, she felt her power subtly change. She couldn\u2019t control it easily\u2014in fact, she felt like a toddler trying to lift a horse\u2014but now it was hers.\nPenance gleamed as she pulled back the arrow on its shining string. Her will surrounded and focused it all as the string came back to her cheek.\nHer madra channels were strained to the point of bursting. Dross was shouting warnings in her ear; something about her mind being overtaxed. But she was in a state of pure focus.\nThe Weeping Dragon\u2019s claw descended on her, but she locked her sight on its head. The blessing from Cladia Arelius meant that Mercy could see her more clearly than usual, and even her concentration felt sharper. She had no room for distractions.\nMercy released the arrow, and the rush of power she\u2019d unleashed overwhelmed her.\nAs she blacked out, she didn\u2019t fall into the shadows of her mother\u2019s hatred. Rather, she fell into comforting, soothing shadows.\nHer last thought before she passed out was confidence that someone would save her.", "2dd5de09-a37e-4889-95b9-622b9f480ca3": "* * *\n\nThe Weeping Dragon\u2019s claw fell, and Yerin used her Flowing Sword to catch it.\nHer sword shone red-and-silver, but even with all her power and the assistance of her Remnants, the Dreadgod\u2019s claw was still shoving her down to the ground. Closer to Mercy.\nDo something, Dross!\n[Already done! Look!]\nShe didn\u2019t actually look, but the blessing of the Oracle Sage helped her see a dark star of power flashing toward the Weeping Dragon.\nMercy\u2019s arrow. She\u2019d unleashed Penance.\nIts copy, at least. Lindon had used the prototype Penance arrowheads to make his three arrows, but Yerin was clearer than anyone on the difference between these and the original.\nThe true Penance didn\u2019t need to make contact or to be shot from a bow. It didn\u2019t unleash an attack, it just decided who was dead.\nThis carried the same intentions, but watered down. The Weeping Dragon\u2019s castle-sized jaws snapped down onto the arrow.\nLightning and an ancient, defiant will crashed against Mercy\u2019s shot.\nYerin didn\u2019t know who held the edge in that contest, but the Dreadgod\u2019s focus on Penance pulled pressure away from its claw. She shoved it aside.\nRed essence sprayed from a crack in her sword. Not a good sign; Netherclaw was breaking down.\nThat wasn\u2019t much of a twist. The sword had been made for fights between Archlords, not to be swung freely against Dreadgods and Monarchs. Every Reaper\u2019s Sword technique cut into the weapon\u2019s lifespan.\nBut Yerin took her stance again.\n[There\u2019s a limit to the number of times you can use that technique. You know, right?]\nShe drew her sword back. Yeah. Sword can\u2019t take it.\n[This is what I was afraid of. You can\u2019t take it, Yerin. You can\u2019t.]\nYerin hadn\u2019t taken stock of her own condition since leaving the Oracle Sage. She\u2019d stolen power from a Sage and a Herald, using those to keep herself going, but that was slapping a cast on a broken arm.\nThe longer she kept fighting, the worse she\u2019d be. She was on her last legs.\nTake a breath or two, Yerin told Dross. I can\u2019t even feel it.\n[That\u2019s a perfect example of why I\u2019m worried.]\nThe Penance arrow finally tore through the lightning gathered between the Dragon\u2019s fangs. But the Dreadgod\u2019s attack still deflected the arrow. Instead of shooting down the Weeping Dragon\u2019s throat, it blasted off to the side.\nHarmless.\nMercy\u2019s attack had taken a significant amount of the Dreadgod\u2019s madra and attention to deflect, so it wasn\u2019t useless. But it hadn\u2019t left a wound.\nYerin would have to do it herself.\nShe took the stance and prepared the Reaper\u2019s Sword.\n\u201cEnough!\u201d the Weeping Dragon shouted.\nIts authority crushed Yerin. The will of the Dreadgod was as fierce as a storm and as imposing as the greatest of dragons. It ruled this space absolutely.\nShe struggled against its willpower, forcing her arms along. Yerin could move, could maybe use some techniques, but her Reaper\u2019s Sword was shut down. It was too delicate a balance to maintain.\n[Block it!] Dross shouted. [Block! Block!]\nYerin activated Netherclaw\u2019s binding and a pair of silver-edged red claws were Forged into the air over her head. With those, the sword itself, and all six of her sword-arms, she defended.\nThe Weeping Dragon\u2019s claw slammed down onto her.\nDespite the supernatural strength of her Steelborn Iron body, she was still too weak. She felt as if a building collapsed on her\u2014no, if a building collapsed on her now, she would shrug it off.\nShe felt as if a Dreadgod had crushed her.\nCrunching came from bones all over her body, and half her vision shut down. She couldn\u2019t feel her right arm anymore, so she grabbed her sword in her left.\nYerin felt no pain.\nThe Remnants she\u2019d stolen made it over to her. They had largely fallen apart, losing their shape, but they still focused their remaining power and will into a shining storm protecting her overhead.\nShe fed on them, forcing her body back into shape.\nAnother lightning-sheathed claw fell. She attacked it with a slash of madra.\nHer world narrowed, and that was all she did. She swung her sword at the claw that fell.\n[Yerin, you\u2019ve got to run! Yerin!]\nDross\u2019 voice faded away.\nAll Yerin could hear was the ring of steel on steel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nZiel was hovering high in the sky, hurling techniques down into the battle from gaps in the Weeping Dragon\u2019s storm, when he felt the Penance arrow miss.", "5359c417-ff9d-4a1e-8914-416f68b1a8ca": "* * *\n\nZiel was hovering high in the sky, hurling techniques down into the battle from gaps in the Weeping Dragon\u2019s storm, when he felt the Penance arrow miss.\nMost of those gaps were created by attacks\u2014madra from Yerin, usually, that broke through the dark clouds in a wave of silver-red.\nZiel had watched the whole battle with the Oracle Sage\u2019s blessing and following Dross\u2019 instructions, keeping the storm or the movement of the Weeping Dragon from killing Orthos, Little Blue, Mercy, or Yerin. His role wasn\u2019t flashy, but he\u2019d slid aside enough glancing blows to know he was making an impact.\n[There!] Dross lit up a spot with purple, and Ziel dutifully hurled a script-circle in time to stop a movement from the Dragon from toppling a mountain onto Mercy.\nBut the Penance arrow had flashed by the Weeping Dragon\u2019s head. Ziel\u2019s heart was ashes.\nThat had been it. Their last, best chance.\n[Grab it!] Dross called. [Ah, not with your hands. That might kill you. Grab it with a script; we don\u2019t want to lose it.]\nZiel Forged a ring of emerald runes that encircled the empty space where the arrow was flying. When Penance tried to pass through, it slowed. And broke the ring.\nHe Forged another, then another, but that didn\u2019t take his full attention.\nHe was watching the fight.\nThe Dragon was infuriated by the attack on its life, shaking the clouds with its roar. It was focused on Yerin now, hammering her with lightning and claws.\nShe was about to die.\nSomewhere behind him, Ziel felt the arrow finally crawl to a stop in one of his script-circles.\nDross, can you show me what to do?\n[Well, uh, not exactly. I\u2019m not as powerful as I was in my original body. I\u2019m not a complete copy of myself, more like a smaller one. I can guess!]\nGood, Ziel thought. He used a script to toss himself the arrow. Don\u2019t tell me how likely this is to work. Just help me.\n[I have tried to talk everyone out of sacrificing their lives today. Why is no one listening to me?]\nHow many lives is it worth to take down a Dreadgod?\nZiel knew the answer to that.\nIt was worth at least one.\nHis core was almost totally empty again, but he squeezed the last madra out. He dropped his Enforcer technique, and his shield. Even his aura control left him, and he began to fall.\nGreen runes spun around him.\nThe power of the Penance arrow had already numbed his hand. His hand might have died, but he didn\u2019t care; at least his grip hadn\u2019t loosened.\nHe had no authority over this weapon. He couldn\u2019t use it himself.\nBut he had done nothing while the Weeping Dragon killed his friends once. This time, he would do more. He would do something.\nSilver runes sprang up around the green ones.\nWithout his madra, the Grand Oath Array had been burning its own structure to fuel itself. Unless Lindon could repair it, this would be the last use of the Rune Queen\u2019s masterpiece.\nAll his soulfire, all his madra, all his will went into this one technique.\nAnd in the sky above the clouds, a massive shield appeared. Bigger than when he had first advanced to Sage.\nThe Shield Icon sang in his heart.\nBeneath him, the Weeping Dragon was approaching rapidly as he fell. It looked like he was falling into a vast river of sapphire scales.\nWith force aura, he pried open his dead fingers and released the white arrow with the gleaming black arrowhead. It fell next to him.\nZiel turned his attention to the rings of script flying around him. He focused them both onto the arrow.\nThis Dreadgod was the cause of endless suffering.

The second the battle ended, her soul oath released her, and she moved.\nThe Monarch walked out of shadow onto a scene of complete devastation.\nMalice was no stranger to Dreadgod battlefields. She had created more than a few of them herself. But the objective of fighting a Dreadgod was usually to minimize its destruction, which often prevented the land from becoming this\u2026nightmare made manifest.\nFrom one end of the sky to the other, the earth looked as though it had been tilled by a cosmic farmer. Mountain ranges were torn down, but new mounds of earth rose in different places. Floods churned and washed down valleys, while lightning snaked around corners to hunt down prey.\nThe maps would have to be re-drawn, but there wasn\u2019t much of significance in this corner of her northwestern empire. If the battle had strayed further north, she might have lost important fortifications, and south of here was Sacred Valley.\nIf she had to lose something, this was a small price to pay.\nShe would have paid far greater. Lindon was on the verge of death.\nThat was exactly where she wanted him.\nIf he died, he would pass his power to the other Dreadgods. It pained her that the blow on the Weeping Dragon was lethal; that would be a difficult problem to deal with tomorrow.\nBut for today, she had a window of time before the Dragon finished dying.\nShadows crept out from beneath her, sliding along the terrain. It was hard to tell how much time she had left before the Dreadgod died\u2014the Void Icon and the Storm Icon had both been used to obscure the future here. Though both workings were fading, she still couldn\u2019t rely on her glimpses of the future, so she had to lean on her experience. In all of history, to her knowledge, the Weeping Dragon had only been killed once.\nMalice had to be quick.\nHer shadows crept up to Mercy, Orthos, and Little Blue. The lockdown of the Weeping Dragon was fading, so she would be able to transport them away soon.\nWith those in her keeping, she could control Lindon. But she only needed so many points of leverage.\nMalice summoned her bow. The shaft shimmered like crystalline ice, and she Forged an arrow on the string.\nShe would rather have the Silent King Bow. Truly a unique item made of irreplaceable components. Worthy of Reigan Shen\u2019s collection. But it would be too hard to slip a Dreadgod weapon into the space connected to her shadow without a claim of authority over it. She would have to pick it up herself.\nIn the instant after she appeared, Malice took aim at Yerin.\nCasually, she loosed her arrow.\nYerin was too weakened to resist. She was on the verge of death already, and even the most halfhearted attack from Malice carried echoes of the Bow and Shadow Icons. And if you took Dreadgod and Abidan weapons out of contention, her bow was top-class.\nYerin was as good as dead, so Malice shifted her attention to Ziel.\nShe felt the change in Fate too late.\nMalice\u2019s arrow was already in the air when the Dreadgod breathed its last.\nHunger aura erupted out from the Weeping Dragon, empowering the last three Dreadgods: the Wandering Titan, the Bleeding Phoenix, and the one she\u2019d named herself. The Empty Ghost.\nThe shadow of a dark future suddenly loomed in her mind.\nMalice saw where her arrow would pierce Yerin\u2019s chest only a split second before Lindon awakened.

Lindon would hardly be conscious at this point.\nAs though he\u2019d heard her thought, Lindon vanished.\nShe didn\u2019t feel the working until he\u2019d already moved, and her heart rate spiked for a second until she saw what he was doing.\nHe reappeared standing along the back of the Weeping Dragon\u2019s colossal corpse. His right hand dug into its scaly hide.\nLindon began to Consume.\nThere was a core binding somewhere inside the Dreadgod\u2019s length, but monstrous power threaded through its every inch. Lindon devoured it mindlessly, driven by his own arm. She sensed no conscious thought in him, only hunger.\nShe was safe.\nMercy\u2019s body slid inside the shadow, and Malice let out a breath. As expected, she could get away with this. So long as she didn\u2019t do anything to affect Lindon\u2019s spirit, he wouldn\u2019t notice. Her shadow slithered back, closing the gate to her void space.\nShe froze.\nHe was gone.\nThere was no way she should lose track of anyone with that much power. It was like not being able to spot the sun at noon. Nonetheless, he was gone.\nShe found him standing beneath her.\nHis eyes were wide and mindless. Blank. Lindon stared up, but she was certain he couldn\u2019t see her. Or anything. He still wasn\u2019t fully awake.\nWhite fingers twitched like someone was trying to puppeteer him. His arm lunged to the ground, dragging his shoulder with it.\nThen he punched into her shadow.\nMalice felt the intrusion into her void space. She could work her will against it, if she chose.\nInstead, she stayed very, very still.\nThe white arm came out holding onto Mercy\u2019s wrist. Lindon still stood with a blank expression, his eyes staring somewhere past Malice. But he pulled Mercy free of the shadow. Contrary to Malice\u2019s expectation, he didn\u2019t Consume her, only sat her onto the ground.\nLindon\u2019s head twitched. His eyes slowly began to focus. On Malice.\nHer breath stopped.\nA moment later, she cast herself into the Way. She wasn\u2019t particular about her destination, and she didn\u2019t feel safe until after she\u2019d left the swirling blue corridors and stumbled out into a jungle on the same continent.\nLocal sacred beasts sensed her and fled.

The labyrinth\u2019s defenses were still in effect, and he couldn\u2019t deactivate them until he arrived, so the portal looked out over the slopes of Mount Samara.\nHe strode through, preparing an order for the labyrinth.\nThe portal stretched, and it felt like he was trying to walk through a flexible fabric. He pushed further, focusing his will, but in the end he was shoved backwards. He couldn\u2019t cross his own portal.\nLindon stood in shock. He understood what was happening, but it was still unpleasant to see.\n[You\u2019re too heavy to move,] Dross explained.\n[Sorry, is it rude to say you\u2019re heavy?] another Dross asked.\n[Bloated,] a third Dross suggested.\n[Bulky.]\n[Metaphysically dense,] said a red Dross. The other spirits turned and looked to him.\n[You don\u2019t get it, do you?] Lindon\u2019s Dross said to the red one.\nLindon\u2019s friends were on the verge of death, and he had just fought through some of the hardest battles of his life. His patience was hanging by a thin thread, but he pushed down his frustration. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to act like a group, I\u2019d prefer it if you took on different appearances. This is confusing.\u201d\n[Yerin thought so too. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s all a play. We can match up our thoughts, so you\u2019re basically talking to an individual. Just because I\u2019m a mighty hive-mind now doesn\u2019t mean you have to address me with respect.]\nWhen Dross mentioned Yerin, Lindon tried not to look at her. She was resilient and would certainly make a full recovery. He had to remind himself of that every few seconds.\nLindon let his portal fade. He couldn\u2019t walk through it for the same reason that the Silent King had been forced to swap places with the Wandering Titan.\nDreadgods were too heavy to move. If they wanted to transport themselves anywhere, they had to use a trick, like trading with something of equal weight.\nThat had disturbing implications for Lindon\u2019s existence. Especially taken with the fact that the white flesh of his right arm had climbed past his shoulder and was pushing into his chest. He didn\u2019t sense anything unhealthy or harmful from those parts of his body; in fact, they felt healthier than his other side.\nBut his flesh and blood were being transformed by a Dreadgod\u2019s. That couldn\u2019t be good.\nThis is worth it, Lindon told himself firmly, and he set the problem aside.\nIf the portal wouldn\u2019t work, he needed another location to bring his friends. He reached out his will to a location where his authority was strong.\n\u201cCome to me,\u201d Lindon ordered.\nHe expected Windfall to fly toward him and pass through the portal, but instead space warped above him and then he was covered in shadow.\nLindon looked up to see a dark blue cloud hanging inches over his head.

Don\u2019t worry about it.]\n\u201cHow close?\u201d\n[Not worth worrying about! Just stop worrying, take my word for it, and never ask me that question again.]\nLindon waited for an answer.\n[\u2026If the Weeping Dragon had died one second later, Ziel would be dead,] Dross finally muttered. [If it held on for five more seconds, Yerin would be dead and Mercy would be gone. If Ziel\u2019s strike had missed the Weeping Dragon, they would all be dead.

His own imagination provided them.\nEvery sentence hammered another nail into Lindon\u2019s heart. He had almost failed them all.\nHe would have to do better.\n[It\u2019s hard for me to read your thoughts when you\u2019re like this, but I\u2019ve still hung around here for a while.

You\u2019re planning to fight all the rest of the battles on your own.]\n\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d Lindon cleared his thoughts so Dross could see them more easily, and Dross\u2019 eye widened. \u201cWe will not stop,\u201d Lindon said.\nEithan had descended from the heavens in search of companions. Suriel didn\u2019t fight alone, and she had encouraged him to seek out Yerin and to fight alongside the others.\nClearly, no amount of power was worth moving forward alone.\nHe had chosen to believe it. So he chose to continue believing.\nDross wiped an imaginary tear from beneath his eye. [It\u2019s every parent\u2019s dream to see their little boy grow into such a fine young Dreadgod.]\n\u201cYou\u2019re not my parent.\u201d\n[Well, I don\u2019t like your parents, so I choose to replace them.]\nLindon returned his attention to the three injured people in front of him and rolled up his sleeves. \u201cI\u2019d like to try something, but I need an isolated experiment first.\u201d\n[As usual, I\u2019m three days ahead of you.] Dross highlighted a cut to the side of Mercy\u2019s eye. [Flying debris. Should be simple to heal.]\nOzmanthus had mentioned that restoration should be in the purview of the Void Icon\u2019s authority, and Lindon intuitively felt that to be true. He could reduce these wounds to nothing, essentially making it so that the injuries never happened in the first place.\nOr so he thought. His previous efforts had accomplished nothing.\nHe focused on the cut on Mercy\u2019s head, which wrapped around from above her eyebrow and almost reached her ear. \u201cBegone,\u201d Lindon commanded.\nThe wound vanished immediately.\nIt didn\u2019t fade, as he had expected from healing. The injury ceased to be.\n[Huh. That worked exactly as it was supposed to. Try these.]\nDross highlighted several small cracks along one of Mercy\u2019s madra channels. Little Blue had soothed them with pure madra already, but clearly Mercy had stretched herself too far again.\nWhile these injuries were self-inflicted, they carried authority from Penance and the Silent King Bow.", "30a960d4-af50-44d4-9f8f-ce40c356e892": "He could reduce these wounds to nothing, essentially making it so that the injuries never happened in the first place.\nOr so he thought.

Little Blue had soothed them with pure madra already, but clearly Mercy had stretched herself too far again.\nWhile these injuries were self-inflicted, they carried authority from Penance and the Silent King Bow. That made them resist Lindon\u2019s will a bit, and he pushed against them as he issued his command.\nHe had authority over the Penance arrow and the Bow. The cracks resisted him for a second, then vanished.\nLindon stepped back, waiting for Mercy to wake up. She didn\u2019t. Her core didn\u2019t refill either, nor did her soulfire, though they should have been depleted by the same action that wounded her channels in the first place.\nDross happily explained Lindon\u2019s own thoughts, but Lindon didn\u2019t listen. It was against the nature of the Void Icon to add. It was, inherently, the power to subtract. To remove.\nSome problems would have to heal on their own.\nWith that, Lindon turned to Ziel. His wounds were like a combination of Mercy\u2019s and Yerin\u2019s. He had not only strained his body and spirit to their limits, but he had taken a beating while doing so.\nThese wounds took more of Lindon\u2019s concentration to erase, but soon Ziel was healed. There were no complications from Lindon\u2019s working\u2014at least, none that Lindon or Dross could find\u2014and Ziel\u2019s breath came more easily.\nOrthos and Little Blue stepped away from him in relief.\nThen Lindon turned to Yerin. His worry had lessened quite a bit. Not only was Yerin sturdier than Ziel, but the healing had gone so well that he had few doubts of his ability to restore her.\nThough she looked terrible. She was covered in so many burns, cuts, and bruises that he could hardly see her skin, and while many of them had begun to fill in with silver-red madra, many had not.\n\u201cBegone,\u201d Lindon commanded her wounds.\nHis willpower strained and reality twisted, but none of her injuries disappeared. The working passed with no effect.\nUpon closer examination, he understood. The Weeping Dragon had attacked her with the full force of its will. It had caused them intentionally and directly.\nTo heal them, Lindon would have to exert effort greater than what the Dreadgod had spent.\n[Hold back,] Dross advised. [What\u2019s a night of sleep to Yerin? She\u2019ll heal these on her own.]\nLindon scraped together his already-strained mind. He set aside his concerns about his own fate and invited the Void Icon closer.\n\u201cBe not.\u201d\n[Yeah, no, that\u2019s a good point. Why listen to me?] Dross muttered.\nBy the time Yerin\u2019s wounds had lessened and her breath rose and fell evenly, Lindon was covered in sweat and his own breaths were ragged. In terms of his willpower, he\u2019d traded another series of blows with the Weeping Dragon after the fight was over. And he hadn\u2019t even restored her fully; Yerin had her own healing to do.\nBut given what Lindon had Consumed from the Dreadgod\u2019s corpse, it was still a worthwhile trade.\nAll three were asleep now, and even Orthos and Little Blue had gone off to rest. Little Blue was very excited about the prospect of having a human-sized bed all to herself.\nWhich left Lindon to consider his other problems.\nHe opened the Soulforge and entered, carrying the shards of Yerin\u2019s broken sword with him. Dross drifted after him.\n[I can hear what you\u2019re thinking, and it\u2019s a bad idea. You know it\u2019s a bad idea, because I\u2019m using your memories to tell.]\nLindon laid the shards of Netherclaw onto the silver altar at the center of the Soulforge and considered trying the same thing on the sword that he\u2019d done to the injured outside.\n[I knew you were thinking that. It won\u2019t work. You know it won\u2019t work. It\u2019s completely broken. That would be like reviving the dead.]\nSuriel had revived the dead, and Lindon was working with the same principles of restoration as she was. Albeit at a far, far, far lower level.", "45712562-c950-4b79-abbe-8fe255d24ffb": "Which left Lindon to consider his other problems.\nHe opened the Soulforge and entered, carrying the shards of Yerin\u2019s broken sword with him.

Albeit at a far, far, far lower level.\n[Just fix it normally! Soulsmith it up!]\nLindon considered what the right command for removing this damage would be.\n[You\u2019re already tired! Take a break! Why not some nice, relaxing Soulsmithing?]\nLindon had every intention of ignoring Dross, but he still gave in without an attempt. He couldn\u2019t figure out a way to frame this working so that the Void Icon would recognize it as removing damage.\nNo matter how he saw it, bringing something back from a state of total destruction was adding, not subtracting. He couldn\u2019t work his way around that contradiction. It was probably possible, but certainly not easy.\nLindon summoned Genesis from his void space and switched it to the pure madra side, hammering Netherclaw back together. It wouldn\u2019t work quite as well as it had before\u2014this was something like stitching a wound closed. But it would hold for a while.\nAt least until Lindon had the material to make Yerin a real sword.\nSpeaking of which\u2026\n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Lindon asked Dross.\n[More ready than you are. You haven\u2019t even given me a look. You should take it out of your soulspace, though, before your spirit ruptures.]\nLindon summoned the core binding of the Weeping Dragon.\nImmediately, a gust of humid wind blew out of nowhere inside the isolated world of the Soulforge. Clouds began to form over Lindon\u2019s head, lightning crackled from the runes on the platform beneath his feet, and he heard the distant echo of a dragon\u2019s roar.\nBefore the Dragon Icon could form, Lindon reaffirmed his authority over the space. The effects died down, but the vital aura was still in chaos.\nThe Weeping Dragon\u2019s core binding was a golden jewel of many facets, like a diamond as long as Lindon\u2019s arm. Blue lightning flickered in its depths, and its edges shone blue. At the far end, the gemstone came to a point.\nIt had been larger than a house, but Lindon had compressed it down when he put it into his spirit. Physical size, for purely spiritual items, was largely a matter of choice.\nLindon and Dross immediately identified the different components of the binding, which could produce different techniques depending on how madra was circulated. But this looked more like a normal binding than the Silent King\u2019s.\n\u201cThis would make a great launcher,\u201d Lindon noted.\nDross projected images all around the central altar of the Soulforge. Potential forms for the Weeping Dragon\u2019s weapon.\n[I\u2019m partial to this one!] Dross\u2019 tendril rested on a cannon.\nIt was similar to the Blackflame cannon Lindon had created in the past. Smooth and aggressive, the handheld launcher construct was modeled on the appearance of the Weeping Dragon.\nBest of all, this binding could keep itself balanced. He wouldn\u2019t need multiple Striker bindings like he had for his creations in the past.\nNot that he would need more power. With Lindon\u2019s power flowing through a cannon like this, he could pierce right through the Wandering Titan.\n\u201cTakes a lot of madra,\u201d Lindon noted.\n[You could fire it two, even three times! And it only takes two minutes in between shots!]\nIt would only take two minutes between shots if Lindon didn\u2019t mind how long the construct lasted, but he wanted these weapons to follow them past their ascension. To give the cannon a long lifespan, he would need to perform maintenance after every shot.\nThe other functions, like summoning storms or living bolts of lightning infused with draconic will, could be used with impunity.\nLindon moved from the cannon and laid his hand on a spear. \u201cThis is the more balanced option, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n[Since when do you use a spear?]\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking it was for me.\u201d\n[Oh, are you planning on resurrecting Jai Long?]", "bcc375c5-3eca-4157-9260-0a236c518d5c": "With Lindon\u2019s power flowing through a cannon like this, he could pierce right through the Wandering Titan.\n\u201cTakes a lot of madra,\u201d Lindon noted.\n[You could fire it two, even three times!

[Was that too soon? No, I feel like it wasn\u2019t soon enough.]\n\u201cThis will give us an easier time after we advance.\u201d That was one of the reasons they\u2019d chosen a bow for the Silent King\u2019s binding instead of something that could be more easily used by Dross. The physical form created connections to Icons.\n[Yeah, if you want the Spear Icon. And the dragon\u2019s breath will be much weaker in this form.]\n\u201cBut easier to use, and the other techniques will be simple to control. Doesn\u2019t the Eight-Man Empire train with the spear?\u201d Maybe because Dross had brought up Jai Long, Lindon could easily imagine a fighting style formed around supplementing spearmanship with flexible dragons of lightning.\n[If you give this work of art to Larian, I will haunt both her and you for the rest of your lives. Even more than I already haunt you, I mean.]\n\u201cIf we consider who\u2019s going to be using it\u2026\u201d Lindon looked up to Dross. \u201cThere\u2019s one obvious choice.\u201d\nDross heaved an exaggerated sigh and floated over another image.\nThis one was a huge weapon, as large as Lindon was tall. Though, considering the sheer size of the Weeping Dragon, they wouldn\u2019t be short of physical materials.\nIt was a huge, two-handed hammer. The head was made of bone, one side carved to resemble the Weeping Dragon\u2019s snarling face. The grip was covered by blue leather, and the entire thing trailed lightning.\nOr so Dross imagined it. The final product\u2019s design would differ, assuming they actually made it.\n[His madra\u2019s not the most compatible with it. It\u2019ll be hard to Forge his scripts while using the binding at the same time. He\u2019ll need the spiritual resistance of a Herald to use it. Isn\u2019t it in bad taste to use a weapon that looks like the monster that destroyed your home?]\n\u201cHe struck the final blow,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cHe slayed the monster that destroyed his original sect, made its body into a weapon, and turned that weapon against its brothers. That doesn\u2019t sound like bad taste, it sounds like the makings of a legend.\u201d\nDross gave a short sigh of disappointment. [I don\u2019t want it to be a hammer, all right? The dragon\u2019s breath function is completely wasted. And every storm artist uses a hammer!]\n\u201cNot the ones we\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n[Because they have taste.]\nLindon sent his spiritual sense back out through the entrance to the Soulforge. Fortunately for him, Ziel had woken already.\nYerin and Mercy were still unconscious. Yerin had to heal wounds on her own, and Mercy was once again in a state of wrestling mentally and spiritually more than physically. She would probably sleep the longest.\nBut they could settle this quickly.\nLindon left the Soulforge open and made his way to Ziel. To Lindon\u2019s surprise, Ziel spoke eagerly the second the door opened.\n\u201cWe got him, didn\u2019t we?\u201d Ziel demanded. \u201cThat\u2019s his binding, I can feel it! \u2026isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cYou got him,\u201d Lindon said.\nZiel took a deep, shuddering breath. He passed his hand through his hair, between his horns. Then he gave a broad smile and collapsed onto the couch.\n\u201cGot him. We got them both. It\u2019s over.\u201d\nThere was a slight hitch in Ziel\u2019s voice, so Lindon took the opportunity. \u201cYou can feel it. That is the core binding of the Weeping Dragon. The sooner we make it into a weapon, the better. Since you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ziel said immediately.\n\u201cYou struck the killing blow. Not only do you deserve it, but you should be able to exert auth\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n[Well, you heard him!]", "d6d021a2-40c5-4675-8264-6510c4786310": "To Lindon\u2019s surprise, Ziel spoke eagerly the second the door opened.\n\u201cWe got him, didn\u2019t we?\u201d Ziel demanded. \u201cThat\u2019s his binding, I can feel it! \u2026isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cYou got him,\u201d Lindon said.\nZiel took a deep, shuddering breath.

I have some lovely plans for a bell that you might want to see\u2026]\nLindon tried again. \u201cPardon, but may I ask why you don\u2019t want it?\u201d\nZiel stared at the ceiling. \u201cI\u2019m not using that power. I won\u2019t do it. I\u2019m free of it now.\u201d\nWith that, Lindon let it go. \u201cAll right. Would you object to a hammer made from the Wandering Titan?\u201d\n[Getting a little ahead of ourselves, aren\u2019t we? Just kidding, I\u2019ve already made plans.]\n\u201cMake it a shield,\u201d Ziel said.\nLindon returned to the Soulforge with less direction than before. \u201cAll right, then we\u2019re back to asking who can use the binding.\u201d\n[Don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re not excited,] Dross said.\nLindon was.\nThe Bow of the Silent King had never been made for him and didn\u2019t suit him. It was made for Mercy to grow into, once she was ready.\nYerin\u2019s madra wasn\u2019t compatible with the Weeping Dragon\u2019s, and of course the Bleeding Phoenix would make the perfect weapon for her. Ziel had refused this chance, and Orthos and Little Blue would have a difficult time establishing authority over the Weeping Dragon\u2019s binding.\nWhich left Lindon himself.\nLindon opened his void key and summoned the weapon he had chosen from the Uncrowned King tournament years before.\nWavedancer flew out eagerly. Dross landed on its back and caressed the flat of the blade. [We never gave you the attention you deserved, did we?]\nThe flying sword had never been made with a binding. In exchange, it was solid and well-crafted. A strong, if unexciting weapon. Fury had recommended it to Lindon as something he could control well even as an Underlord, but that would serve him through Archlord.\nLindon had come a long way since then.\n[Obviously, these materials will explode if you try to put the Weeping Dragon\u2019s binding inside.] Lindon knew that, but Dross sent an illusion of a massive explosion anyway. [We\u2019ll be borrowing its form, structure, and significance. And we\u2019ll have more than enough excess materials.]\n\u201cI have an idea for that. Can you model it for me?\u201d\nDross saw Lindon\u2019s idea, and his purple eye lit up. [You see? Isn\u2019t that way more fun than a hammer?]", "79c5e82c-3b24-4fd9-8c5b-6c4ef8fda2a5": "21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIteration 300: Vesper\n\n\nOzriel hated fighting at a disadvantage. Not that anyone liked it, but Ozriel was always the strongest being in any given world. He had rarely had occasion to practice fighting with a disadvantage.\nEithan, however, had some recent experience.\nHe dodged shots from Tal\u2019gullour, bolts of gold that warped space as they streaked past him. At the same time, he turned strikes from the Mad King himself, but his black armor cracked a little more every time.\nEven with his powers returned, Ozriel was not what he had been. For one thing, he was fighting with neither his Scythe nor his Presence. The Mantle of the Reaper allowed him to extend his authority farther, effectively granting him more power, but that was only enough to help him keep up.\nMore importantly, his time as Eithan had diminished him. He hadn\u2019t forgotten anything, but he was not as sharp as he had once been. Not so singularly focused.\nIn mortal terms, he was rusty.\nHe would recover in only a matter of years, but he was hardly in the best condition to be fighting the Mad King while down two of his most powerful tools.\nFate was still cloudy in this sector, even to him, but he saw no way out of this. He doubted there was one, short of Suriel bringing back a miracle.\nHe was tempted to fall back on old instincts.\nA seemingly casual sword-slash from the Mad King sliced through the void where Ozriel had once been. He slipped aside, leaving a star behind him to split in two and then detonate, but the old Ozriel wouldn\u2019t have only dodged.\nOnce, he would have taken the chance to attack. If he died, he would take the enemy with him into death.\nThis time, he dodged.\nEithan fully expected to die here. But before he did, he would draw this out as long as he could. Maybe he could buy enough time for someone to save him.\nNeither Eithan nor Ozriel liked waiting to be saved.\nA seal from the fortress-world snared Ozriel, manifesting as a golden circle of runic script floating around his left ankle. It sealed his motion for just a moment before the Reaper dissolved it, but this time the sword-strike from the Mad King landed.\nThe slash had to crash through several Titan barriers before it reached Ozriel\u2019s upraised arm, but it still stripped away his armor. Now his hand, from fingers to elbow, was unprotected.\nThat was how the fight proceeded.\nOne at a time, his limbs were laid bare. When he could no longer sacrifice those, he had to take hits to his chest until his breastplate cracked and peeled off.\nFinally, the divine artifact protecting him dissolved and blew away into space like so much dust.\nOzriel drifted in the jumpsuit Abidan often wore beneath their armor. It had enough protections on it to qualify as legendary armor in its own right, but by the standards of this fight, it was practically ordinary cloth.\nHe was left with a conjured sword, his Mantle of billowing black flame, and his winning smile.\nHe had no doubt which of those the Mad King would target first.\n\u201cGo,\u201d Ozriel commanded.\nHis Mantle detached from his back and twisted into the Way. This wasn\u2019t likely to work, but maybe\u2014\nDaruman reached out a hand and pulled the squirming length of black fire from nowhere.\nThen he tore the Mantle of Ozriel in half.\nOzriel felt the artifact\u2019s destruction. He\u2019d crafted it himself, and it was a very real symbol of his own power reflected in the Way. It was a part of him.\nNow, he was less the Reaper than he had been a moment ago.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had enough Reapers,\u201d the Mad King said.\nOzriel felt hot rage and an urge to kill. But he channeled those into his most annoying Eithan smile. \u201cToo late for that,\u201d he said. Then he winked.\nHe had hoped that the Mad King would take the bait and ask questions, but no such luck. Oth\u2019kimeth, the Conqueror, smelled conquest.\nThe Fiend peeled out from its host, regarding Ozriel with a burning gaze beneath its crown. Daruman\u2019s eyes held no more pity.\nHe had been waiting for a chance like this for millennia.\nIn a way, so had Ozriel. Eventually, someone was going to get him. He had hoped to see Lindon and Yerin ascend, but there was always something to regret.\nAt least he was leaving something behind.\nThe Reaper folded his arms and faced death with a smile on his face.\nDaruman gave him one nod of respect before bringing his sword down.\nOzriel dodged.", "28a00c07-7c6a-4581-8107-b2eaa6fc5b13": "But he channeled those into his most annoying Eithan smile. \u201cToo late for that,\u201d he said.

That had been too close.\nHe had indeed intended to stand there and face death with a calm smile. But at the last second, he\u2019d felt something approaching. And someone.\nSuddenly he remembered all the things he had to live for and ran like a fox with its tail on fire.\nThe Mad King sensed the same thing he had, and the golden circles from Tal\u2019gullour suddenly surrounded him like a cage. They weren\u2019t just to trap him, though; they sealed up the entire world of Vesper.\nA moment later, a black slash sliced the entire ceiling of the cage in half.\nOzriel\u2019s heart leaped.\nA blue rift formed into the Way, and a familiar figure popped out.\nZakariel the Fox glared at him. \u201cHow are you still alive? I lost a bet.\u201d\nDaruman slashed out at her. He didn\u2019t hit her\u2014she disappeared even faster than she\u2019d appeared\u2014but the attack was still wiped out by the Scythe in the hands of a white-clad Judge.\nBut not the Judge he\u2019d expected.\nOzriel doubted his own eyes when he saw Makiel holding the Reaper\u2019s Scythe. If he hadn\u2019t recognized his own handiwork, he might have wondered if this was another fake.\nMakiel said nothing on his arrival. He didn\u2019t acknowledge Ozriel at all, though the Scythe squirmed in his grip out of desire to get back to its creator.\nThe Hound slashed down, and a significant chunk of the universe behind the Mad King vanished.\nNot the Mad King himself, of course. Gold circles appeared from Tal\u2019gullour, and\u2014anchored by the fortress\u2014Daruman weathered the attack.\nOzriel held out a hand. \u201cReturn that to me before I take it.\u201d\nEven that one attack with the Scythe had sent cracks crawling up Makiel\u2019s armor. If not for the Hound\u2019s personal skill and power, he\u2019d have died swinging it once.\nMakiel still didn\u2019t glance at him, but he did respond. \u201cWould you do better, with no armor and no Mantle?\u201d\n\u201cI could do better than that if I was missing both arms and an eye.\u201d\nThe Mad King wasn\u2019t idly letting them speak. Workings of energy and chaos crawled around the Iteration, in the form of golden script-circles and stomach-churning creatures respectively.\nAs expected, Daruman intended to take them along with him. If he could remove even one Judge, he would die happy. And there were four\u2014no, Zakariel had already scampered away\u2014three Judges here.\nMakiel snorted at Ozriel\u2019s words. \u201cYou can see the result yourself.\u201d\nYes, Ozriel would most likely die using the Scythe.

He turned to face Ozriel squarely, and a new branch of Fate shone as it became more likely. Makiel could banish the Scythe and draw his own Sword.\nUnarmed, Ozriel would stand no chance. He\u2019d have to take over the Scythe while he had the chance, but that meant acting first. A standoff.\nOver the same old debate. Let things stagnate or pay the cost for change.\nAs chaos crawled across the sky of Vesper, icy determination leaked up from Ozriel\u2019s soul. Nothing had changed. Nothing would, as long as Makiel was in charge.\nMaybe his primary target shouldn\u2019t be the Mad King after all. If Suriel were the only survivor, that would be for the best. He found that Fate, with her as the only survivor, and began tracing back the path to that future.\nAcross from him, Makiel was doing something similar.\nThen blue fire filled Ozriel\u2019s vision.\nA pair of wings filled with the same fire he\u2019d seen in Lindon\u2019s marble.\n\u201cI\u2019ll persuade him,\u201d Suriel said to Makiel. \u201cWe\u2019re out of time.\u201d\nSure enough, Vesper had been surrounded by the Mad King\u2019s working. Now, there was no way out of here without losing at least one of them.\nOzriel was about to throw out a remark just to needle Makiel, but Suriel spun on him.\n\u201cOzmanthus wouldn\u2019t back down,\u201d she said.\nOzriel felt like he\u2019d slammed into a wall.\nHe didn\u2019t want to be Ozmanthus. He\u2019d worked so hard not to be.\nHe wanted to be Eithan.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were going to say that,\u201d Eithan muttered.\nSuriel didn\u2019t give him a smug expression, but he could tell she wanted to. \u201cI can at least hide that much.\u201d\n\u201cI will use the Scythe,\u201d Makiel said.\nAnd, though it twisted everything inside him, Ozriel nodded. \u201cTake it.\u201d\nWith that permission, the energy of the weapon suddenly flowed more smoothly. It still wouldn\u2019t be easy for the Hound to use, but better than before.\nOf course, they were still trapped.\n\u201cDie,\u201d the Mad King commanded.\nThe ensuing attack was beyond anything he\u2019d used against Ozriel in their most recent battle. No surprise, considering how much time they\u2019d given him to prepare.\nRather than the slash of a sword stretching across the gulf of space, it was more like the entire Iteration collapsing in on them.\nMakiel wielded the Reaper\u2019s Scythe in both hands, bending all his will to reducing the attack to nothing. Suriel reinforced him, setting up Titan barriers that disappeared almost as soon as they were formed.\nWell, it wasn\u2019t as though Eithan wanted to sit back and do nothing.\nWithout his Mantle, he couldn\u2019t work on the same scope as before, but that didn\u2019t mean he was useless. Shells of Way-power appeared around Makiel, sturdy enough to resist planet-crushing force. Ozriel threw up shield after shield, as well as stranger barriers. He reached deep into reality with the powers of the Ghost, reinforcing the reality of Iteration Three Hundred.\nHe worked on so many levels at once that he struggled to keep up with it all, and the other two Judges did the same.\nFinally, the Scythe swept away the Mad King\u2019s working.\nBut a golden light from Tal\u2019gullour struck Suriel like a hammer-blow.\nShe was launched out of the world, into the Void, where Fiends set upon her. Ozriel had seen this coming; it was the best of all possible outcomes.\nEven so, that didn\u2019t mean he intended to let it stand.\nHe leaped through space, sending a message to Makiel as he did so. \u201cI need\u2014\u201d\nThe message was cut off when he saw what was waiting for him when he re-materialized behind the Mad King: a two-handed sword hovering in front of him hilt-first.", "ae899c6c-5142-42b3-bb06-3e4f71fadef4": "He reached deep into reality with the powers of the Ghost, reinforcing the reality of Iteration Three Hundred.\nHe worked on so many levels at once that he struggled to keep up with it all, and the other two Judges did the same.\nFinally, the Scythe swept away the Mad King\u2019s working.\nBut a golden light from Tal\u2019gullour struck Suriel like a hammer-blow.\nShe was launched out of the world, into the Void, where Fiends set upon her.

The veins of purple light crawling over its steel hissed with displeasure as it radiated contempt for him.\nNonetheless, the Sword of Makiel tolerated his touch.\nThere was no moment of hesitation. The instant Ozriel appeared, he seized the Sword and swept it toward the fortress of Tal\u2019gullour.\nThough the weapon had inherited its master\u2019s distaste for Ozriel, it still felt right in his hands. He had been considered a potential successor to Makiel, once.\nAnd the key to this weapon was that its strikes were absolute. It hit multiple possibilities at once, closing out branches of Fate that involved its attacks failing.\nThere were countermeasures, of course, and the Mad King knew them.\nChaos twisted for Ozriel, warping destiny and causality in a working that would stop Makiel\u2019s Sword and possibly kill Ozriel as well.\nExcept for the colorless light that swallowed up the working, reducing it to nothing. The Reaper\u2019s Scythe.\nThe Sword of Makiel swept across, shattering the golden circles that defended Tal\u2019gullour and leaving a scratch across its surface that stretched for thousands of miles. Ozriel gave a brief sigh of disappointment. With his Mantle, he would have cleaved through the entire planet-sized fortress.\nBut this time it was his turn to play support.\nIn the future, he saw the Mad King hitting Makiel, and he launched an attack of his own to close off that possibility.\nMakiel reacted perfectly, since he\u2019d known exactly what Ozriel would do.\nTo Ozriel\u2019s frustration, they made a great team.\nThough they were trapped and cornered, missing weapons, and not in their best condition, they were still the two most talented Abidan alive. And for the first time ever, they willingly fought in sync with one another.\nOzriel was still irritated. At his full strength, he wouldn\u2019t need this. And Makiel was getting the center-stage role, leaving Ozriel to play cleanup.\nThen again, wasn\u2019t that where an Arelius shone the brightest?\nOzriel could feel the shift when the Mad King realized he couldn\u2019t beat them. Once again, he redirected his attacks to the unarmored Ozriel.\nThere were several options available. And this time, Eithan picked the one that Ozmanthus would never consider.\n\u201cTell Suriel I\u2019m counting on her,\u201d Ozriel sent.\nInstead of evading, he slashed out with the Sword of Makiel. His blow cracked the Mad King\u2019s bone helmet in half.\n\u201cGotcha!\u201d Eithan said.\nJust as the Mad King\u2019s return strike erased him from the universe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nReigan Shen did not have time for the Silent Servants, and yet here they were. Standing in the middle of his white-and-gold courtyard as he prepared to spend yet another fortune in built-up spatial treasures to move on with his plans.\nHe bitterly regretted giving them access to his teleportation anchor, but it had been a different time then. Before the stars had gone dark, back when Reigan had planned to use the cults to defeat the other Monarchs.\nWith the world as it was, the cults had either lost their usefulness or become a liability.

That was not the attitude to take with a Monarch, but her brother\u2019s presence had made her bold.\nBalari, the Herald of the Silent Servants, stood with his arms crossed at his sister\u2019s side. He covered his mouth just the same and his Goldsign was similar, but he followed a different Path. While Reigan could certainly kill them both, Balari\u2019s presence would make the battle a headache to win quickly.\nThe Lion Monarch forced a smile and spread his hands. \u201cClearly, I have broken no oath, as I am unharmed. I assure you\u2014\u201d\nThe Sage bared an inch of her sword. \u201cDon\u2019t lie to our faces! We know you can break your oaths. You\u2019ve flaunted that power against our enemies, so don\u2019t take us for fools.\u201d\nIn fact, Reigan hadn\u2019t thought the Silent Servants had known about his oath loophole. But he had leaned on it a little too easily, even loaning it out to others. He had been too arrogant, but he\u2019d never intended to lean on his little trick against the truly powerful.\nNow, he found himself stuck.\n\u201cMy oath to you remains intact,\u201d he assured them. \u201cI have not betrayed you, I have treated you as my own sect, and I have empowered the Dreadgods. Are they not stronger than ever before?\u201d\n\u201cOur King is dead.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how is that a violation of my loyalty? Surely you can\u2019t expect me to have predicted that a Dreadgod would need a bodyguard.\u201d\nThe Sage looked like she was straining at her very limits not to draw her sword. \u201cWe were decimated by Emriss Silentborn, and you did nothing! It was only by the grace of the other Monarchs that we were allowed to survive at all, and now we\u2019re so bound in oaths that we\u2019re all but useless!\u201d\n\u201cThen what good are you?\u201d Reigan roared. The marble vibrated with his voice, as did the vital aura and space itself. \u201cIf I can\u2019t waste the seconds it would take to kill you, then I certainly cannot waste another breath speaking to you! If you want to throw away your lives so badly, kindly do so before the Void Sage devours you.\u201d\nAn annoying alarm in Reigan\u2019s mind alerted him to a problem in his collection. He almost tore apart the Silent Sage in frustration, but this wasn\u2019t her fault. Not directly, anyway.\nWithout another word for the Silent Servants, he tore open a gold-edged portal to one of his vaults and stepped inside.\nFor the first time, the Herald Balari spoke. \u201cSoon, your empire will crumble. And it will be your fault.\u201d\nReigan let the portal shut behind him, cutting off the Servants. They were right about one thing, at least.

But because he was, he knew it originated from the scripted golden collar around the man\u2019s neck.\nIrritably, Reigan reached out with his senses and expanded the Remnant\u2019s physical form. It harmlessly enlarged; this was more of a technique to view the insides of a spirit or spiritual construct than a true increase of its size.\nHe had become much more proficient at this skill since absorbing the Soulsmith inheritance of Ozmanthus Arelius, and the man\u2019s instincts gave him a more thorough sense of the problem.\nMadra channels spun throughout the room in what should have been healthy loops, but the lanes of light were twisted, mangled, halfway cracked. Storm madra burst from them in uncontrolled flares.\nStretched to such a size, so that Reigan was standing in the center of Tiberian\u2019s Remnant, the problems were clear. Reigan summoned a few scales of Weeping Dragon madra, slapping them on the broken channels haphazardly.\nHe had performed these repairs several times before. The process was growing less effective, but he didn\u2019t need Tiberian\u2019s memories or personality to be flawless. He needed the man to be a weapon.\nThough he still wanted Tiberian\u2019s appearance to remain intact. No sense in having a treasure you couldn\u2019t show off.\nWhen Reigan finished patching up the newest cracks, he shrank the Remnant back down. Tiberian shuddered on the floor now, twitching and groaning like he suffered a disease.\n\u201cGet up,\u201d Reigan said in disgust.\nA moment later, as though pulled by invisible puppet strings, Tiberian did. He held a hand to his head. \u201cWhat\u2026did I\u2026\u201d\nReigan stood over him, letting himself enjoy a moment of victory. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t break so many soul oaths.\u201d\nThe Remnant\u2019s hand drifted from his forehead down to his collar. \u201cAh\u2026That\u2019s right. Owning me and using me as a weapon wasn\u2019t enough. You had to torture me as well.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to admit, that was a clever design.\u201d While his hired Soulsmiths had made the device, Reigan had come up with the basic concept and structure for the collar himself. He had based it on his research into the armor of the Eight-Man Empire, and the collar exploited a link between his own soul and Tiberian\u2019s.\nPrimarily, it enforced obedience. But it also allowed him to hand off the consequences of broken oaths.\nNot too many, and none too powerful, lest Tiberian fall apart completely. But he had survived what would have been, to a living sacred artist, total spiritual collapse.\n\u201cI would admire your death trap more if I were not caught in it,\u201d Tiberian said, tone dry.\n\u201cMaybe your ancestor will return from the heavens and save you,\u201d Reigan said, but the taunt fell flat. As soon as he said it, he realized that might very well happen.\nTiberian had noticed the same thing, and eyebrows of crackling lightning lifted. \u201cI look forward to seeing you caught in your own trap.\u201d\nReigan reached his spiritual perception inside himself, into his soulspace, to caress his life insurance. The Wraith Horn.\nHe hoped it would be enough to preserve his life.\n\u201cIf I am caught,\u201d Reigan Shen said, \u201cthen I will not be the only one.\u201d With his weapon repaired, he opened the portal again and left.\nIt was time to go find his new allies.", "bcf05f42-9a64-47de-b9fa-7835a6b5b04f": "22\n\n\n\n\n\nLindon stood and addressed the others, who had all grabbed seats around the large room at the top of Windfall.

None of us came out of this with even more strength than when we started. Did we? Did we, Lindon?\u201d\nLindon considered his words. \u201cI have seen some\u2026benefits.\u201d\n\u201cThis match is unfair. I want to talk to a judge about the rules.\u201d\nSuriel was a Judge, and she was indeed the first one to give Lindon his edge, but he decided not to point that out.\nZiel raised a hand. \u201cThe Grand Oath Array is in bad shape, unless you can repair it.\u201d\n\u201cI think I can, but I\u2019m not certain. Try not to use it for now.\u201d\nZiel shrugged. \u201cWorth it.\u201d\n\u201cWe now have two Dreadgod weapons,\u201d Lindon said.\nYerin brightened. \u201cYou made it already?

Let\u2019s talk while we test! Where is it?\u201d\n\u201cIn my soulspace,\u201d Lindon said.\nSomething occurred to Yerin. A thought he was hoping she wouldn\u2019t have for a while.

If the Dreadgods are all dead\u2014except Lindon, of course\u2014we have a matter of hours to get the Monarchs out of the world before he loses his mind.]\nZiel laced his fingers together. \u201cSo we have five targets before we take out another Dreadgod. Northstrider, Sha Miara, Akura Malice, Reigan Shen, and Emriss.\u201d\nLittle Blue shuddered, and Orthos scowled. \u201cShould you say their names like that?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re veiled,\u201d Lindon assured him.\nMercy still looked horrified. \u201cBut you can\u2019t move yourself. If they show up, you can\u2019t even run.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re making the situation sound worse,\u201d Lindon assured her. He felt like he had said that too many times in the last two minutes. \u201cI can still move with the labyrinth. But yes, the Monarchs can now outrun me. So I can\u2019t chase them all down and threaten to eat them if they don\u2019t ascend.\u201d\nHe had intended that as a joke, but no one laughed.\n\u201cWe know what we need,\u201d Orthos rumbled. \u201cWe need Monarchs of our own.\u201d\nDross made an obnoxious alarm sound. [Wrong! We need you to improve without advancing. You know how Lindon had a body sort of like a Herald even when he was a Sage? Like that. We need to make you into half-Monarchs.

I made them, and you contributed to killing the Dreadgods, so that should give you enough of a connection. With one of those, you\u2019ll be a match for the Monarchs.\u201d\n\u201cI am concerned about our speed,\u201d Orthos said.\nMercy held up four fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s really only four targets left, isn\u2019t it? Emriss will ascend once she gets rid of the others.\u201d\n\u201cWe think,\u201d Ziel muttered.\nLindon was confident they could trust Emriss. She had practically handed him the key to the Silent King. Then again\u2026\nLindon turned to Dross. \u201cHave we heard from Emriss?\u201d\nDross shook his head. [She must have sensed the battle with the Weeping Dragon, but she\u2019s made no attempt to contact us. And the other Monarchs were harassing us freely, so she wasn\u2019t keeping pressure on them.]\n\u201cThen what is she doing?\u201d\n[Either she has a secret plan that we can\u2019t possibly comprehend, or she\u2019s been captured by the Monarchs.] Dross shrugged. [Could be both. Especially when the Eight-Man Empire held back the Dragon for us. They seem to be her allies, so the other Monarchs could have made a move while they were gone.]\n\u201cSo, first up on the list,\u201d Yerin said. \u201cFree the tree.\u201d\n\u201cCould they have killed her?\u201d Ziel asked.\n[Emriss formed herself up from a Remnant, but she isn\u2019t one anymore. She\u2019d leave a Remnant, like anyone. I can\u2019t imagine Reigan Shen or any of the others wanting to take on another Monarch\u2019s Remnant and the Dreadgods.]\n\u201cWhich brings us to the last point,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cThe Dreadgods have grown.\u201d\nHe could feel them, even now. Almost as clear in his spirit as Orthos and Little Blue. The Bleeding Phoenix and the Wandering Titan were far from each other, and they were having a great time.\nLindon clenched his right fist. \u201cThey\u2019re feeding.\u201d\nThe others quieted. None of them extended their spiritual sense to find the Dreadgods, but they could all feel it.\nThe Titan and the Phoenix had gotten the same boosts to their power that Lindon had, though they hadn\u2019t also created any Dreadgod weapons. Perhaps that would give him the edge.\nNo matter what, they would be more aware and more awake in addition to more powerful. Somewhere, the people of the world were facing down an apocalyptic crisis.\n[Just one more reason to speed things up!] Dross said cheerily.\nThe mood had hit rock-bottom once again. Even Ziel\u2019s newfound resolve seemed to have cooled, though he still seethed with palpable motivation. Besides Dross, they seemed to have all come to the conclusion that they\u2019d signed up for an impossible mission that now had to be completed in no time.\n\u201cWe can do this,\u201d Lindon assured them all.\nMercy shrunk in on herself. \u201cThat\u2019s what you said last time.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we became much stronger,\u201d Orthos said.\n\u201cNot enough,\u201d Ziel pointed out.\nLittle Blue sighed and picked at the corner of the table.\n\u201cSo what\u2019s the difference this time?\u201d Yerin asked.\n\u201cThis time, we\u2019re sticking together,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to start by gathering allies.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\u201cYou should not be so calm,\u201d Northstrider said to his prisoner.\nEmriss Silentborn watched him from the inside of a tank.", "f0d1f280-8311-49d0-9829-97228d6408d1": "Dross said cheerily.\nThe mood had hit rock-bottom once again.

It had been designed to hold dragons, so it was a massive glass bubble suspended in a dark ocean. The inside was dry and barren, a stretch of sand.\nThere was no life in this pocket world. Nothing to give off life or dream aura except Northstrider himself, and he kept his own aura under tight control. He also allowed no sunlight or water inside, keeping the interior of the tank lit only by dim scripts.\nEmriss could sustain herself for years with no food or water, but she would find it uncomfortable. That was the idea.\nHowever, she had set herself up anyway. She\u2019d formed a chair out of one of the boulders by molding earth aura, and she lounged on it as he watched. Her eyes were shut peacefully, her hands folded over her midsection.\n\u201cWhy not be calm?\u201d she asked in return, without opening her eyes. \u201cWould panic accomplish more?\u201d\n\u201cWe will release you under one of two conditions. Either you ascend immediately, or you swear an oath to help us fight the Empty Ghost.\u201d\nShe mouthed along with the words \u2018Empty Ghost,\u2019 though this couldn\u2019t have been the first time she\u2019d heard the name. \u201cAnd if I wait here?\u201d\n\u201cYou stay here as your people are slaughtered by Dreadgods.\u201d\nHe had expected a reaction to that. She\u2019d given up centuries binding the Silent King. Her greatest fear was losing her population to the Dreadgods, and she would do anything to stop that fate.\nOr so he\u2019d assumed.\nShe continued lounging at her ease. \u201cMm. That would be a pity. It would take two, three generations to rebuild. Trees tend to take a long view, you know.\u201d\nIt was a bluff. She was hiding her reaction. Northstrider knew that, and his oracle codex agreed. He\u2019d gone over the codex with scripts and workings of the Way, and he was certain no trace of Dross remained.\nNorthstrider bet on that chance, matching her stoicism. \u201cVery well. I\u2019ll present you the same offer in a week. Next time, I\u2019ll come with dream tablets from Dreadnought City.\u201d\nHe manipulated the water around him. For their entire conversation, he had been floating in his artificial sea, speaking to her through the glass. Now he tore open a portal to the outside, ready to escape.\n\u201cSee you next week,\u201d Emriss said casually. \u201cIf you have that much time.\u201d\nNorthstrider looked back over his shoulder and allowed a small smile to crack his lips. Then, without another word, he passed through the portal.\nAs soon as he was through, in his latest fortress at the bottom of the Trackless Sea, his smile was replaced once again by a scowl. He had pretended to have a strong hand to call Emriss\u2019 bluff. She would be panicking now, he was certain, though he couldn\u2019t examine her directly without her realizing.\nIf she wasn\u2019t bluffing, though, then he was wasting his time. If she really did think on the glacial time scales of a tree and she wasn\u2019t concerned about losing this generation of her population, he didn\u2019t have any leverage over her.\nHis codex showed him that wasn\u2019t the case, but he no longer trusted the codex\u2019s predictions as he once had. Certainly not against Emriss. He wouldn\u2019t put it past her to have foreseen this possibility.\nNorthstrider\u2019s current headquarters was called the Sunken Tower, and it was the most advanced fortress he\u2019d ever designed.\nIt was like a spear of dark stone driven into the bottom of the ocean.

Each of its thirty floors was home to many facilities and pocket worlds, carrying out research that he could confidently say was unmatched in Cradle.\nOthers had gathered around the Tower. Northstrider didn\u2019t lead a sect of his own, but greatness always attracted followers. And in times like this, where he was weakened and could not attract attention, followers could be useful.\nEmriss\u2019 cell was accessed by a scripted doorframe at the end of a hallway with Herald-level constructs and workings of great authority.\nHe left that hall on the thirtieth floor and flew the short length to the roof. A hatch opened at his approach, and a script prevented water from rushing inside.\nNorthstrider splashed upward into the ocean. The darkness of the sea\u2019s depth was kept at bay by circular lights that floated here and there like miniature moons. Lesser structures spilled out from the Sunken Tower, all around, each releasing light from its windows. Many were covered by scripts that pushed back against the pressures of the depths, allowing human Golds to survive here.\nUsually, when he saw that sight, he wondered if he had stayed here for too long.\nLarge organizations were weights tying a sacred artist\u2019s hands and feet. Obviously there were some projects that required cooperation, but such relationships should be taken only for a limited duration. But the longer he stayed here, the more hangers-on would pile up.\nThose were the thoughts that usually plagued him, the questions that haunted him. This time, he was grateful for the assistance.\nTwo Archladies and an Archlord knelt before him. One of the Ladies was human, and she wore a scripted necklace and wristbands that adapted her to this place. No Archlord-level sacred artist could be killed by the pressure here, but speaking and moving quickly would take soulfire, so she used scripted shortcuts.\nThe other two were fish-people, sacred beasts who had taken on humanoid form but hadn\u2019t given up their animalistic traits entirely. Their gray-blue skin and gills were hallmarks of their kind, but Northstrider didn\u2019t have the bias against sacred beasts that many among the Akura clan did.\n\u201cWhat did you find?\u201d he asked them.\nThe first opened her void key. \u201cOur apologies, Monarch. Herald sacred beasts are scarce since the fall of the Dragon King.\u201d From the key\u2019s portal, a frightened serpent darted out, trying to escape.\nNorthstrider seized it in one hand. It was an Archlord-level dreadbeast, and thus disgusting to the eye, but it was close enough to a dragon for his needs. He Consumed it completely.\nIts energy filled him, and he vented excess madra into the darkness behind him. Light of many colors lit up the dark, and a small piece of what Lindon had taken from him was restored.\nNorthstrider turned to the Archlord. He hadn\u2019t come with prey, but with an elixir made for Heralds. The Monarch favored him with a nod before turning to the human Archlady.\nShe shifted and looked at the ground. \u201cI found a Herald-level Remnant, but I was driven off.\u201d\nNorthstrider had given them weapons to prevent that, so he was displeased, but not surprised. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cEastern Ashwind, in what used to be Xorrus\u2019 territory.\u201d\nNorthstrider wondered whether the potential return was worth the risk. The further he stayed from Lindon, the better. At least until he regained his strength.\n\u201cI will go,\u201d Northstrider said. \u201cYou will all be repaid.\u201d He turned to lower himself back into the Sunken Tower.\nTo his surprise, the human Archlady spoke again. \u201cI did feel the attention of the Empty Ghost on me, but it did not act.\u201d\nNorthstrider stopped. \u201cWere you contacted? Did you hear any messages in your thoughts?\u201d His scan of her spirit revealed nothing strange.\n\u201cNo, Monarch. I was only concerned for you.\u201d\nUgly anger took over Northstrider\u2019s heart for a moment.\nShe was talking about a boy who had grown fat on bounty he\u2019d stolen from Northstrider.", "53433586-c5d3-43ba-bfb7-d2608c6d084a": "\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\u201cEastern Ashwind, in what used to be Xorrus\u2019 territory.\u201d\nNorthstrider wondered whether the potential return was worth the risk.

I was only concerned for you.\u201d\nUgly anger took over Northstrider\u2019s heart for a moment.\nShe was talking about a boy who had grown fat on bounty he\u2019d stolen from Northstrider. Just by suggesting Lindon could be a threat, she was insulting him.\nBut Northstrider was hundreds of years old. He took control of himself immediately. She did not intend the disrespect, and what was more, she was right. Lindon was a threat. She had said nothing inaccurate.\n\u201cI have plans to deal with him,\u201d Northstrider said.\nThen his spirit shouted a warning.\nAt the same time, the lights around his fortress turned red. An alarm split the deep, and sacred artists came boiling out of the surrounding buildings. The three Archlords were instantly battle-ready.\nIntruder alert, his oracle codex informed him. The Empty Ghost.\nNorthstrider knew that already.\n\u201cHold,\u201d Northstrider instructed. \u201cI will deal with him.\u201d\nThis was his fortress. The current seat of his power. Here, his authority could not be surpassed.\nNorthstrider willed himself back inside.\nHe reappeared in a simple gray room on the thirtieth floor. It branched off into five hallways, one of which led to Emriss Silentborn\u2019s prison.\nThe room was empty except for a swirling, white-edged portal. Lindon stood on the other side, arms clasped behind his back.\nNorthstrider felt dark amusement take him. He had calculated this possibility. In fact, he had expected Lindon would reach a tipping point of metaphysical mass before Consuming the Weeping Dragon, but obviously there was a margin of error.\n\u201cThere are easier ways to get my attention, Ghost,\u201d Northstrider said.\n\u201cApologies, I must have lost my way,\u201d Lindon replied easily. \u201cI was looking for Emriss Silentborn.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps I have her imprisoned here.\u201d Northstrider stood back and beckoned down the hallway with one black-scaled hand. \u201cI invite you to come check for yourself.\u201d\nLindon couldn\u2019t cross the portal, and they both knew it.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather send one of my friends to check for me, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cThe invitation extends to you alone.\u201d\nNorthstrider\u2019s oracle codex spat out possibilities, and his mind worked just as quickly. What could Lindon do here? He knew he couldn\u2019t transport himself here, so why had he opened the portal in the first place?\nThe codex proposed a possibility, and Northstrider agreed with it. Lindon already had one Dreadgod weapon. It was entirely possible he had another.\nUsing such a weapon through a portal was a tricky possibility. If the output was too great, the portal itself would break.\nThere was only one question Northstrider had. Why had Lindon waited? Why not use the weapon immediately?\nHe focused his will, prepared to break the portal the instant Lindon pulled a weapon, but Lindon didn\u2019t seem inclined to do it.\n\u201cI wanted to talk with you,\u201d Lindon explained. \u201cI have questions.\u201d\nNorthstrider remained silent, using his codex to predict whether this could be a trick. What would Lindon gain by playing for time?\nThere was no substantial reason Northstrider could think of. The Dreadgods were rampaging at that very moment.\nAfter a second of silence, Lindon spoke again. \u201cI\u2019ll go on, then. I had great respect for you. I want to know why you never ascended.\u201d\n\u201cI told you already, and I dislike repeating myself.\u201d\nLindon glanced around the empty room. \u201cAs I understand it, you did not want to bow to anyone. You are the fish who doesn\u2019t leave its pond because it fears the ocean.\u201d\nNorthstrider\u2019s ugly anger returned. \u201cWatch your tone, boy.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not even the biggest fish in this pond. What is there to cling to?", "a160245b-37d4-4fe7-b6be-f5024df46b31": "\u201cI wanted to talk with you,\u201d Lindon explained. \u201cI have questions.\u201d\nNorthstrider remained silent, using his codex to predict whether this could be a trick.

With disdain and fury, he crushed the portal.\nThe portal, however, refused to be crushed.\nLindon held out his hand, pitting his will against Northstrider\u2019s. \u201cI suspect there has been a misunderstanding. Dross tells me you\u2019re calculating what I get out of this interaction. What angle am I playing? You\u2019re looking at it the wrong way.\u201d\nNorthstrider\u2019s rage burst free of his constraints, and he snarled in response, \u201cYou\u2019re nothing but a dog with sharpened teeth. You\u2019re alive because you were a Judge\u2019s pet.\u201d\n\u201cThis was not for my sake,\u201d Lindon continued, \u201cbut yours.\u201d\n\u201cA speck of dust could challenge the Dreadgods if a Judge decided to grant it power. You\u2019re not special. You\u2019re a sideshow for them.\u201d\n\u201cRelease Emriss and ascend. For my past respect, I\u2019m giving you a chance.\u201d\n\u201cHow dare you look down on me? I earned what I have.\u201d\nLindon\u2019s black-and-white eyes carried the coldness of the void. \u201cVery well. I\u2019ll see you soon.\u201d\nWithout Lindon\u2019s will to support it, the portal winked out.\nHow quickly can he arrive here? Northstrider asked.\nDifficult to estimate, his oracle codex replied. Assuming he begins in the western Blackflame Empire, and assuming flight based on aura control, he could arrive here in six hours.\nNorthstrider could have sent out his spiritual sense to see exactly where Lindon was starting from, but Lindon could have shut down such a scan effortlessly. Northstrider hadn\u2019t bothered to try.\nLindon, on the other hand, knew exactly where to find him. If he didn\u2019t, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to send the portal in the first place.\nThe codex continued. If he travels from the nearest branch of the labyrinth, then of course he will arrive much sooner.\nNorthstrider wasn\u2019t concerned about that. He knew where the labyrinth entrance was, and he\u2019d put measures on it that even Lindon couldn\u2019t ignore.\n\u201cSet the evacuation alarm,\u201d Northstrider commanded the construct in charge of the Sunken Tower. \u201cIn six hours, we need all critical projects gone.\u201d\nSix hours wasn\u2019t much time, but it would be enough.\nNew possibility, his codex said. Northstrider\u2019s blood chilled at the words. Information on the Weeping Dragon is limited, but it is theoretically possible to create a method of transportation from its madra. In such a case, the time is reduced to only two hours.\nWhat are the odds that Lindon has been able to create a vehicle so quickly?\nUnlikely. Estimated thirty percent.\nAfter further consideration, Northstrider decided not to move up the timeline of his alarm. That wasn\u2019t enough of a possibility to act on, considering that the most important pieces of the Sunken Tower would be prioritized and moved out within two hours anyway.\nNew possibility, the codex said again.\nDon\u2019t tell me that, Northstrider snapped back.\nAcknowledged. I will not consider this possibility.\nNo, tell me.\nThere are other possible meanings behind the words \u2018I\u2019ll see you soon.\u2019 It could be that he will contact you again, or that he will lure you to come to him. Perhaps he is aware of something that will inevitably bring you two face-to-face.\nNorthstrider\u2019s eyes narrowed.

He couldn\u2019t leave her to his automated evacuation process. And prisoners were always less secure in transit.\nNot enough information to be sure of his intentions, the oracle codex relayed. It is possible the Destroyer left him resources beyond our comprehension.\nThis whole process grated on Northstrider. Having to treat a child like a serious threat and being unable to see through his words. Monarchs were used to making others react to them.\nThen again, he wasn\u2019t in such an easy situation that he could afford to coddle his pride.\nHe strode down the hallway and met the doorframe of scripted jade at the end. After he left instructions with the facility construct and his subordinates, he commanded the doorframe into his void space.\nIt disappeared, along with the entrance to this prison world.\nNow, if Lindon wanted to take Emriss back, he would have to meet Northstrider face-to-face. He couldn\u2019t send Yerin or his other flunkies to do it for him. And while no one Monarch could take on the Empty Ghost alone, he could at least run.\nBy killing the Dreadgods, Lindon had put himself on a timer.\nOnce Northstrider had grabbed the doorframe, he hopped through space quickly and reappeared over an endless expanse of ocean. There were a few nearby buildings hanging from solidified clouds and a few peeking up from the waves, but for the most part, this was an unremarkable stretch of the Trackless Sea.\nIt was only a hundred miles or so from where he started, but it was even farther from the labyrinth entrance. Covering distance quickly was important.\nNow he could make longer jumps. See if Lindon could catch him if he was on the other side of the\u2014\n\u201cCome here.\u201d\nLindon\u2019s voice echoed through the world.\nNorthstrider felt himself being pulled through space, as though he\u2019d been hooked on an invisible fishing line.\nSpiritual perception exploded from him and enveloped the entire world for hundreds of miles. He could even sense the Sunken Tower from which he\u2019d started.\nLindon was nowhere to be found.\nHe is attempting to summon you, his oracle codex informed him. It is unlikely that he has left his original position.\nThat was absurd.\nLindon had enough links to Northstrider to establish some connection, certainly. The Path of the Hungry Deep incorporated hunger, over which Lindon now had more authority than anyone. And Lindon himself used Consume, had grown under Northstrider\u2019s tutelage, and carried around Dross, who had been born in Ghostwater. Even Ziel\u2019s Broken Crown could theoretically be used to create a link, given that Ziel had fought in Northstrider\u2019s name.\nBut there was a good reason the oracle codex had not considered this as a possibility.\nIt would never work. If greater hunger authority was enough to summon him, the Dreadgods could have pulled him to them centuries ago.\nThe only people to have forcibly summoned Northstrider since his advancement to Monarch were the Abidan.\nHe pitted his will against the working, but that took far more of his concentration than it should have. Wrestling Lindon\u2019s willpower felt like a Copper wrestling a tiger.\nHe ultimately managed it, but another command pulled at his soul.\n\u201cCome to me,\u201d Lindon ordered him.\nWeight pulled at him, greater than Lindon should have. It was as though he was being supported by a circle of Heralds and Sages.\nSo, his friends had advanced. Between that fact and Lindon\u2019s Dreadgod weapons, the oracle codex painted a grim picture of the near future.\nAt this rate, Lindon\u2019s attempt was going to work.\nIn that case, Northstrider would ruin it for him.\nHe withdrew the doorframe from his void space and hurled it into the distant ocean.", "b6de1bac-3fd5-497a-9b86-e474c18b6145": "The only people to have forcibly summoned Northstrider since his advancement to Monarch were the Abidan.\nHe pitted his will against the working, but that took far more of his concentration than it should have.
