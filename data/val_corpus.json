That was why he had performed the summoning in the labyrinth, and why he\u2019d sent the others away.\nThis place couldn\u2019t be destroyed.\nLindon was prepared to Consume the Monarch the moment he arrived, but there was no intention to fight. Only a defiant amusement in Northstrider\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cEmriss is gone,\u201d Northstrider said. \u201cI locked away the entrance to her prison.\u201d\nHe had a tone of triumph, as though he\u2019d seen through Lindon\u2019s plan and was a step ahead.\nLindon got the impression that the Monarch had given this too much thought. \u201cI see. That\u2019s disappointing.\u201d\nHe held Northstrider by the throat but released him, despite the pleas of his hunger arm. Northstrider stood with a smug expression and brushed off his ragged clothes.\n\u201cGood. Now we can begin this negotiation. We will start by addressing the disrespect you have shown me.\u201d\nLindon had cleared everything important from this room of the labyrinth, but it had once been a workshop of some nameless researcher. Lindon pulled up an ancient chair and sat with his back to the wall.\n\u201cApologies, but I think there\u2019s been a misunderstanding,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cEmriss will be fine. I\u2019d be surprised if she doesn\u2019t have her own way out of that prison now that you aren\u2019t watching her.\u201d\nNorthstrider kept his expression under control as usual, but Lindon thought he saw a flicker of hesitation. Dross cackled with glee.\nOf course, Lindon wasn\u2019t being entirely sincere. His primary goal had been to retrieve Emriss, but since it did seem that Northstrider was telling the truth about hiding the entrance to her prison, Lindon pivoted to his secondary objective: Northstrider himself.\n\u201cI want you to ascend,\u201d Lindon said.\nNorthstrider\u2019s expressions were always minor, but this time Lindon read scorn in his face.\n\u201cYou can kill me,\u201d the Monarch responded.\nLindon nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s true. But instead, I thought we\u2019d talk. So before you arrived, I spent some time speaking with you.\u201d\nLindon activated the binding he\u2019d prepared in the labyrinth\u2019s walls.\nThe younger Northstrider that appeared was very similar to his Monarch self, except of course constructed from gray-white hunger madra. His eyes were not golden, but he had the same stature, the same stony expression, the same ragged clothes.\nThe hunger echo looked his real self up and down. \u201cYou\u2019re still here?\u201d the Sage asked himself scornfully.\n\u201cPsychological tricks are not the tool to use against me,\u201d the real Northstrider said.\n\u201cYou think this is a trick?\u201d Lindon asked curiously. He wondered if the Monarch really thought so. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can sense this is really you.\u201d\n\u201cIt is a trick nonetheless. My younger self cannot persuade me to ascend.\u201d\n\u201cPathetic,\u201d the hunger echo said.\nThat word hung in the air a little too long.\nOne of Northstrider\u2019s eyes twitched, but he otherwise didn\u2019t respond to the echo\u2019s word.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I told Lindon, then,\u201d Sage Northstrider went on. \u201cI intended to gather power until I could force the Abidan to remove the Dreadgods. If this world is their responsibility, they should clean it up.\u201d\nNorthstrider didn\u2019t respond, but his expression twisted noticeably.\n\u201cWhat happened to me that I would become the one who turns his face from his responsibilities?\u201d\nNorthstrider\u2019s face returned to its usual stone. The echo continued berating his older self with scorn, but Lindon and Dross could tell what the Monarch was thinking.\nHe had decided not to be swayed by this. The willpower of a Monarch was nothing to be ignored, even against himself.\nThat was why Lindon held up a hand to silence the echo for a moment. Even the young Northstrider looked affronted by the gesture, but he begrudgingly stopped in mid-sentence.\nLindon held out a hand to the echo. Just as Northstrider had taunted him by gesturing toward the prison of Emriss Silentborn, Lindon offered him the path to the truth.\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to me,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cListen to yourself. Your memories are stored here in the labyrinth, but you can take them back with Consume.\u201d\nHaving mastered himself, Northstrider didn\u2019t give anything away by movement or tone. \u201cWhy should I dance to your tune?\u201d\nLindon matched his even tone with a polite one.", "110519c0-2db5-43b9-91c6-784bdb1e92b1": "He had decided not to be swayed by this.

[If I couldn\u2019t read your mind, I wouldn\u2019t know how nervous you were. Keep your sweat on the inside, that\u2019s what I always say.]\nLindon couldn\u2019t show his nerves, but he was rapidly losing control of himself. He feared the result of a fight with Northstrider.\nHe wasn\u2019t afraid he would lose. He was afraid of what would happen if he won.\nEven now, it was taking a good half his attention just keeping his Dreadgod arm under control. There were no outward signs, but Lindon\u2019s hand raged against the restrictions. It sensed the presence of hunger madra inside Northstrider and wanted to Consume him immediately.\nIf Lindon did that, he would be taking too much.\nHe had already gone far beyond his capacity by Consuming the Dreadgods. Taking on too much strength and too many memories, at this point, would only speed up his transformation.\nBut he wanted to. Northstrider was a reservoir of strength far deeper than the wells he had created in Ghostwater.\nIt was like burning with thirst and seeing an oasis right in front of him, but trying to hold back from drinking.\nLindon only managed by reminding himself that he wasn\u2019t dying of thirst. In fact, he had already drunk more than he could handle.\nBut the arm of the Slumbering Wraith always wanted more.\nWhile Lindon\u2019s battle raged internally, he gave nothing away on the outside. Northstrider must have been going through something similar, because he examined his echo for a while before turning back to Lindon.\n\u201cWhat will this prove? It will not change my mind.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m betting that it will,\u201d Lindon said.\n\u201cAnd if it doesn\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll do things the other way.\u201d\nLindon had no reason to lie here. If Northstrider wasn\u2019t persuaded, Lindon would use force. In the worst-case scenario, he would have to kill the Monarch himself.\nHis arm struggled against his control at the very thought of killing Northstrider without Consuming him, but Lindon forced it down. He could always Consume some of the man\u2019s power, just not all of it.\nIn fact, wouldn\u2019t his capacity have increased along with his power? Maybe Lindon could handle more than he thought.\n[I don\u2019t like it when you\u2019re having a debate inside your head and I\u2019m not involved,] Dross put in. [If we really do end up killing Northstrider, you should let Yerin do it.]\nLindon\u2019s gut rejected that, even if his head recognized the logic.\n\u201cI need your word that you won\u2019t attack me while my guard is down,\u201d Northstrider said. Lindon wondered if the Monarch was just being prudent or if Lindon\u2019s internal struggle had revealed itself.\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Lindon said.\n\u201cSwear it.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nLindon folded his arms casually and leaned further back in his chair.\nHe could attack Northstrider at any time. In fact, it was harder not to do so. Why would he need a distraction?\nLindon let that reality float in the air while Northstrider\u2019s expression cracked into visible anger.\n\u201cFine,\u201d the Monarch said. He strode forward and reached toward the echo of his past self.\nLindon moved in a blink.\nNorthstrider reacted when Lindon tried to grab his wrist, and their hands ended up striking off one another in a deafening explosion that shook even the reinforced stone walls of the labyrinth.\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Northstrider demanded.\n\u201cWrong technique.\u201d\nLindon had received memories of Northstrider\u2019s Consume technique.

Dross could model them perfectly. He knew when the man was cycling a different technique.\nNorthstrider had attempted to destroy the echo under Lindon\u2019s nose.\nThe Monarch did not respond, but he began slowly moving his madra in the correct pattern. Lindon stepped aside but continued watching.\nThis time, there was no way out. Northstrider Consumed the echo of himself, which flooded into him in a rush of white and gray.\n[I can\u2019t read his mind,] Dross said, [but here\u2019s a simulation of what he\u2019s seeing, based on the memories from the echo.]\nLindon expected a memory, but instead Dross\u2019 eye turned gold and he sported a shaggy mane of hair. [\u2018Rrgh, I\u2019m Northstrider, and I\u2019m smarter than everybody! I\u2019ll solve this Dreadgod problem! I\u2019ll use their power against them!\u2019]\nNorthstrider was still in a trance as he sorted the memories, though he could probably hear, so Lindon responded silently.\nThat was\u2026I do have questions.\n[\u2018Don\u2019t waste my time with questions!\u2019]\nWhy are you doing an impression?\nDross dropped the hair and the eye color, returning to normal with a shocked look on his face. [So I wouldn\u2019t distract you! Didn\u2019t you find it amusing and relaxing?]\nI feel like you could have shown me a perfect simulation almost instantly.\n[Almost instantly. Now you can watch Northstrider while also learning from me! Also, there\u2019s no creativity in replaying exactly what happened. No soul.]\nI\u2019m perfectly all right with that.\nDross grumbled further, but Northstrider had already broken out of the memory. He looked at his palms as though they belonged to someone else, and he seemed dazed.\n[He\u2019s asking the oracle codex if this is a trick. Probably questioning his own memories to see where he changed. Would you like an impression?]\nNo, thank you.\nNorthstrider looked up again, and something about him seemed\u2026lost. Lindon lifted another chair with aura and sent it sliding over to him.\nLindon hadn\u2019t been sure the Monarch would actually use it, but Northstrider collapsed into the chair a moment later.\nHe leaned forward and put his head in his hands. \u201cIf you wanted to shame me before sending me off in defeat, you\u2019ve succeeded. Do what you will.\u201d\n[He\u2019s going to justify this,] Dross predicted. His tone was much more serious than before, which Lindon appreciated. [If we give him time, he\u2019ll come up with a story about how he was right all along. He\u2019s done it many times before.]\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to send you off in defeat,\u201d Lindon said honestly. He waited until Northstrider looked up to say, \u201cI want to send you off in victory. You won a long time ago.\u201d\nOver time, Lindon had Consumed quite a few of Northstrider\u2019s memories. He knew the Monarch better than even Lindon himself had ever realized.\nNorthstrider had justified his position a million different ways, but the truth remained: the man was simply afraid to ascend.\n\u201cI need time to set my affairs in order,\u201d Northstrider said.\nLindon nodded. \u201cAll right. Swear that you will fight with us and that you will ascend immediately on my command, and you can have more time.\u201d\nNorthstrider remained silent.\n[He\u2019s looking through the loopholes in that oath,] Dross said.\nThe loopholes were traps, and Lindon wanted to see if the Monarch would fall for them.

For a Monarch without an established sect or clan, Northstrider certainly had a lot of people counting on him.\n\u201cI will make sure they are taken care of,\u201d Lindon promised. \u201cNow\u2026pardon the disrespect, but I would like you to ascend now. I give you permission to open the Way within the labyrinth.\u201d\nNorthstrider gave him a flat look. \u201cNow you care about disrespect?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always respected you. You mentioned many of those responsible for my growth, and I owe them a great debt, but no less than the one I owe you.\u201d Lindon bowed his head. \u201cThank you for your guidance, Monarch.\u201d\nNorthstrider surveyed Lindon for a moment and snorted.\nHis ascension was not so dramatic as Fury\u2019s.

And Lindon couldn\u2019t go search himself. He\u2019d needed to send Yerin into the Trackless Sea with the labyrinth, flying for hundreds of miles while scanning with her spiritual sense.\nWhich didn\u2019t delay them long, but it was an annoyance.\nThe door opened onto a dark ocean, but Lindon had expected that. For a sacred artist with no water aspect to his Path, Northstrider certainly stuck to his aquatic theme.\nLindon took a bubble of air into the water and moved using aura. It didn\u2019t take long to release the wide, scripted bubble of glass containing Emriss Silentborn.\nShe was reclining on the chair in the form of a dark-skinned human woman, though it was slightly different than the body she\u2019d used before. This time, there was gray in her hair and wrinkles in the corner of her eyes.\nShe wore a crown of flowers although, on closer inspection, Lindon couldn\u2019t tell which part of her hair was made of plants. Patches of her skin seemed to have the consistency of bark.\nEmriss didn\u2019t react until she saw him floating up to the glass, and then she slid off the chair immediately.\n\u201cI was worried I would have to wait,\u201d the Monarch said. \u201cNorthstrider did not last, did he?\u201d\nLindon tapped a finger against the scripted, reinforced glass and shattered it. He held the water back from rushing in using aura, then moved his bubble of air closer to the prison so Emriss could climb in.\n\u201cApologies,\u201d he said, \u201cI tried to get here sooner.\u201d\n\u201cI was prepared to wait for years, if necessary. This does not count as a wait.\u201d\nLindon had expected more questions, but he had underestimated Emriss\u2019 patience. Despite having been captured, she seemed as though she was waiting for the world to move around her. He supposed that, rather than asking for answers, she would sense the world herself once they arrived.\nBut she looked to him, and he felt a scan pass through him like a gentle breeze. \u201cYou didn\u2019t Consume Northstrider\u2019s power.\u201d\n\u201cI persuaded him to ascend,\u201d Lindon said.\n\u201cPity. If you had taken it, his strength would have gone to good use.\u201d\nLindon wasn\u2019t sure whether to take that as a compliment or not.\nDross spun out next to him and gave a fake cough. [I would just like to say it\u2019s an honor to meet you again.]\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been so long since we met, Dross.\u201d They were aboard Windfall now, and Emriss\u2019 awareness spread out. She made a relieved sound and pressed a hand to her chest.\nLindon noticed the concentration of her spiritual sense on the other side of the planet. \u201cNone of the Dreadgods have made it to Everwood yet, and the Monarchs haven\u2019t attacked.\u201d\nHe\u2019d somewhat expected them to, but apparently everyone had enough chaos of their own to deal with.\n\u201cNorthstrider told me that my people were being taken by the Bleeding Phoenix. I assumed he was lying, but there was always the chance.\u201d\n\u201cPardon my rudeness, but I would like to know. How did Northstrider catch you?\u201d\nLindon could feel Emriss\u2019 spirit now, and he would never have expected her to lose to Northstrider. Even if she couldn\u2019t match him in raw power, she had the knowledge and experience to make up for it.\n\u201cIt was him and Reigan Shen together,\u201d Emriss said sadly. \u201cI saw how it would end, so I allowed it instead of burning my strength fighting against it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we will be grateful for your help.\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately, the closer we get to the end, the greater the danger. I\u2019m worried that\u2014\u201d\nEmriss froze in the middle of her words. She gazed off into the distance, and Lindon could feel subtle shifting in the mechanics of the world. It was like hearing the strings of an instrument plucked in the distance.\nThe Monarch summoned her diamond-headed staff and slammed it into the ground. \u201cI understand now why Shen helped to seal me away. He wanted to stop me from seeing this.\u201d\nLindon was going to ask what, but her hand shot up and gripped him by the forehead like a claw.\nThat would have been more threatening to him a few weeks before.\n\u201cSee,\u201d Emriss commanded him.\nLindon allowed the working, and his vision was rushed away to elsewhere on the planet.

Its eggs had merged with trees, animals, sacred beasts, and humans. Bloodspawn roamed in packs, hunting resistance, but most prey delivered itself to the Phoenix willingly.\nThe Dreadgod wasn\u2019t difficult to find.\nThe sun burned red overhead as Reigan Shen approached. He\u2019d transported himself close to this point, but the Phoenix controlled all space in its immediate vicinity.\nA shape towered like a mountain over him, but it wasn\u2019t the Phoenix\u2019s body. It was a twisting, writhing mass of red that pulsed and flickered with every aspect of madra. Together, it formed the shape of one titanic egg.\nThe Phoenix had formed itself into a much, much smaller body. It even looked like a human woman, a motherly figure with bright red hair and beautiful scarlet wings spread out behind her. With his eyes, Reigan couldn\u2019t see any hint of her previous form. The wings didn\u2019t look like they were formed from liquid, but from perfectly real feathers.\nOnly in his transcendent senses did he feel the distorted space around her, like a spiritual disease. She warped the natural order just by sitting there.\nShe sat at a table that had been meticulously set up in the middle of a field, set with a white tablecloth and silverware that looked suspiciously as though they had been taken from Reigan Shen\u2019s own collection.\nThe Phoenix sliced through a slab of roasted meat with her knife, then placed a bite into her mouth. She closed her eyes as she chewed with evident pleasure.\nA giant bloodspawn leaned over her, shading her from the sun.\nReigan was doing everything he could not to turn and run from this place. The Bleeding Phoenix acting human was as terrifying as anything he\u2019d ever seen. Not only was it disturbing enough to see that it could put on such a performance, but why would it do so?\nHe\u2019d communicated his intention to it already, so he\u2019d expected a cordial meeting\u2014more civilized than their last, anyway, at which time he had thought the Phoenix was going to eat him.\n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been long since we\u2019ve met like this, Reigan,\u201d the Phoenix called to him.

Weren\u2019t you going to control us?\u201d\nReigan had prepared himself for this, and he kept himself quiet, but he felt as though his flesh was trying to pull itself free and run away without him.\nHe held up the Wraith Horn. \u201cI could have sounded this at any time.

Reigan pushed on. \u201cWe\u2019re on the same team now. If the adopted son of the Destroyer succeeds in his goals, he will be rid of us. You will fade into nothing, and all my time in this world will be wasted. Who can match him if not for you?\u201d\nShe chewed on the edge of her knife as she considered, and Reigan heard the shriek of the metal warping under her teeth. After a moment, she leaned over to a boulder sitting in the middle of the plain to her right.\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d she asked.\nThe boulder disappeared.\nIn its place was a swirling gold-edged portal. Reigan shivered at the sight; she had hidden that spatial warp even from him. That was a level of skill in the sacred arts that he had very much hoped she hadn\u2019t attained.\nAnd she had veiled the spiritual pressure of the being on the portal\u2019s other side.\nThe Wandering Titan stared through the portal with one colossal eye. Its voice vibrated through aura, drifting through as though the boulder spoke.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need him.\u201d\nReigan\u2019s spirit chilled.\nThe Phoenix pointed the tip of her deformed knife at him. \u201cHe has a point.

It was difficult to say whether she was aware of Emriss watching her meeting or if she was simply exerting her authority over Reigan Shen, but to continue spying on them would have required wrestling wills with the Bleeding Phoenix.\nThat, she would certainly have noticed.\nEmriss had removed her hand from Lindon\u2019s forehead, but now she set her staff aside and took him by both shoulders. She peered with dark eyes into both of his and spoke earnestly. \u201cDo not be taken in by them. Some of my peers believe that the Dreadgods have only gained intelligence after the death of Subject One, but they were always clever. You cannot negotiate with them.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Lindon said.\nHe could feel the influence of hunger madra. Even now, his arm was reminding him of how much power Emriss represented. By Consuming her, he could benefit from her wisdom and experience in addition to her madra.\nWhat could Dross become with a dream Monarch\u2019s power?\nHow long could Lindon live with a tree\u2019s lifeline? He might become so close to immortal that even the other Dreadgods couldn\u2019t kill him.\nThe worst part was that it wasn\u2019t just the arm that was urging him forward. This was the hunger that had been in him from beginning; the desire to get stronger, now taken to an absurd extreme.\nThat was what the Dreadgods were made of. At their fundamental level, they were made to devour the world.\nNegotiating with them was like bargaining with a wildfire. Or a virus.\nA virus that could turn into a mountain-sized monster.\nEmriss saw the sincerity in his eyes and visibly relaxed. She patted him on both shoulders. \u201cGood boy. This is the best chance we have to be rid of them since the last Dread War, so I wouldn\u2019t want us to give it up.\u201d\n\u201cWe have three problems left,\u201d Lindon said.\nDross projected images of Malice, Sha Miara, and Reigan Shen into the air.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re lucky, the Bleeding Phoenix will take care of Shen for us,\u201d Emriss said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never been so lucky. I don\u2019t think his fate ends here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about Sha Miara?\u201d Lindon asked.\n\u201cI can handle Miara. My concern is Malice.\u201d\nLindon looked into the image of Malice, seated on her throne with her legs crossed and shadowy hair drifting behind her. Dross made her adopt a smug smile.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no telling what that girl will do if she feels cornered,\u201d Emriss said sadly. \u201cShe might burn it all down rather than let someone take it, like the dragons she so despises.\u201d\n[Don\u2019t worry, we have a personal contact with Malice. That will make it easier. I\u2019m certain. I haven\u2019t run the simulation, but\u2014Oh, I just did. This makes it harder, doesn\u2019t it? Way harder.]\nLindon stared at the floor in a corner of the room. Mercy was a few floors down, working on the Book of Eternal Night.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll try to talk her into ascending, if we can,\u201d Lindon said.\nEmriss raised one eyebrow. \u201cDo you think that\u2019s worth an attempt?\u201d\n\u201cYes. But not for Malice\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\u201cAs long as you\u2019re willing to do what\u2019s necessary when that fails.\u201d\nLindon could feel Dross\u2019 thoughts in the back of his head. Dross was struggling not to tell him that there was a ninety percent chance Malice would never surrender and would instead go down trying to take as many people with her as possible.\n\u201cI\u2019ll talk to Mercy,\u201d Lindon said.\nEmriss sighed. \u201cGood luck.\u201d", "661712e2-8049-488d-bc62-72397070467b": "24\n\n\n\n\n\nMercy sat in the fifth page of the Book of Eternal Night. She was supposed to be taking it apart, as she had the first four pages, but instead she just let the never-ending nightmare flow around her.\nIt didn\u2019t touch her as much as it had before.\nShe felt Lindon trying to enter the Book and allowed it. He could have forced his way in, but he wouldn\u2019t.\nThe projection of his self appeared a moment later, and Mercy gave him a bright smile. \u201cTea?\u201d she offered. She held out a cup.\nLindon looked from her to the tea set in front of her. She was seated on a blanket spread on the stone floor of this nightmarish cave, with the long-fingered inhabitants of the cavern system lurking around every corner.\nShe had a teapot and one cup, but she conjured another for him and began to pour.\nCautiously, Lindon sat down. \u201cYou seem like you\u2019re doing well.\u201d\n\u201cNot bad, right? Lovely weather we\u2019re having.\u201d Mercy waggled her eyebrows at the constant gloom that infused the air.\nShe handed him a cup.\n\u201cHow are you really?\u201d he asked. He didn\u2019t drink yet.\nMercy looked around herself. \u201cI thought this would be good training for me. If I can keep my mood up here, then it should be easy to face down my mother. Right?\u201d\nLindon paused for too long before he sipped his tea. \u201cI\u2026hope so,\u201d he said. Which told Mercy why he was here.\nA shiver of fear passed through her that had nothing to do with the boundary field stored in this page of the Book. \u201cIt\u2019s time, huh?\u201d\n\u201cWe can give you a little while to prepare,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cI wanted you to have a chance to talk to her. Before I did.\u201d\nMercy could imagine what a talk between Lindon and her mother would look like. A part of her wanted to see that.\nThere was something satisfying about the thought of Akura Malice, Queen of Shadows, having to run from someone several centuries her junior.\nBut Malice lived up to her name. If Lindon cornered her, she would burn the entire clan to the ground rather than surrender. She would do anything to strike back, even if it meant taking the Ashwind continent with her. Or all of Cradle.\nAs long as something of the family survived, she would consider it a victory.\nMercy had practiced keeping her mood up in the middle of hostile dream aura, but now that was ruined. She stood up, tossing the tea aside.\nLindon carefully put his cup down.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a memory,\u201d she told him. \u201cNo need to be neat.\u201d\n\u201cI know, but I don\u2019t want to leave a mess inside your Book.\u201d\nMercy laughed.\nThe fifth page closed at her will, melting away as the world around them shifted to the sixth page. Now they were in a six-sided room, and each of the six walls were mirrors.\nLindon glanced curiously around, although Mercy was a little embarrassed to show this to him. These were her own possible futures. At least, the ones her mother saw and wanted her to consider.\n\u201cAre these real predictions?\u201d Lindon asked. \u201cOr are they illusions?\u201d\nMercy was about to reply when something occurred to her. \u201cCan\u2019t Dross tell?\u201d\nDross appeared in a blink, arms folded and wearing a grumpy expression. [This whole world is made up! I can\u2019t tell what\u2019s real in here, can I? None of it\u2019s real! That\u2019s like finding the driest part of the ocean!]\n\u201cOh, no, I\u2019m sorry!\u201d Mercy put on a concerned face to soothe Dross\u2019 feelings, though she privately thought his indignation was funny. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know either. I thought you would.\u201d\n[Oh yes, of course, I see that. In that case, in my professional opinion, it\u2019s a mix of both. In broad strokes, these are possible versions of you, but they\u2019re presented and arranged to make you focus on certain options.]\nDross sounded so certain that Mercy almost forgot how, a moment before, he\u2019d denied having any idea.\nLindon dipped his head apologetically. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know.\u201d\nDross pressed a tendril to where his chest would be, affronted. [How do you know? I\u2019m Mercy\u2019s Dross!]\nMercy herself hadn\u2019t realized that. She looked to Lindon, uncertain of how to respond.\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t really know,\u201d Lindon assured her.\n\u201cWell, this isn\u2019t the one I really wanted you to see.", "8677522e-c64b-443e-a23a-9448b7e75e47": "\u201cIt\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know either.

I\u2019d like both of your opinions on the seventh page, but it\u2019s\u2026there\u2019s a lot of my mother in it.\u201d\n[I\u2019ve seen it!] Dross insisted.\nLindon nodded. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d\nMercy believed that, but she wasn\u2019t sure she was. She had to shift her mentality again, as she\u2019d done when she controlled the Silent King Bow.\nShe wasn\u2019t working against her mother. Malice had lost her way a long time ago, and she was hurting the people she meant to protect.\nMercy had to do her mother\u2019s job.\nShe turned to the seventh page, and their surroundings dissolved another time. This time, she was face-to-face before an Empress.\nThe Netherworld Empress was clearly based on Akura Malice\u2026or perhaps it was the other way around. She had dark hair, though it didn\u2019t flow like living shadow, and her eyes shone like cruel amethyst stars. She wore a crown of silver and elaborate ceremonial robes.\nWith a black bow of darkness in one hand and a spear at her side, she stood over a battlefield. It stretched for miles, and Remnants picked through thousands of strewn bodies. Aura of death and destruction choked the air, but the entire space was dominated by the will of the Empress.\nShadows rose from the bow like smoke, and with it in her hand, she gave off an impression of absolute control. As though she saw everything, had stood before this slaughtered army alone, and could stand before a hundred more.\nIt was hard for Mercy to meet her eyes.\nShe had forcibly opened the seventh page before, but it was meant to be mastered when she was a Herald. Mercy had a difficult time keeping her thoughts clear here, and she was supposed to integrate the Empress into herself. This was a manifestation of her own power, after all. Or at least what was supposed to be her own power.\n\u201cIncredible,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cDross, can you tell how she did this?\u201d\n[She built an image of her ideal self. She\u2019s so clear about it, and she put so much of her will into it, that it resonates with a bunch of Icons. You can sense that kind of thing more clearly than I can, though.]\nLindon began muttering. \u201cBow Icon, Shadow Icon, Strength Icon\u2026is that the Crown Icon? It must be.\u201d\nMercy struggled upward, trying not to kneel before the Empress. \u201cHow can you tell?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s something of an instinct, but it\u2019s like imagining how well something matches an ideal. She makes me think of the ultimate archer, ruler, shadow artist, and I\u2019d say she was intended to represent ultimate power as well. The energy in the page is meant to take you to Herald, but I can see how this might guide you to Sage instead.\u201d\n[Or afterward,] Dross pointed out.\nMercy suspected that was the case. The Book of Eternal Night was meant to contain Malice\u2019s ideal Path, and therefore it must end at Monarch.\nShe finally caught her breath and was proud of herself for adapting, until she looked up to meet the Empress\u2019 eyes.\nThose purple beacons of light were shining on Lindon.\nThe Empress was focused on him, and she had her bow half-drawn. She glared at Lindon with the oppressive weight of her willpower.\nLindon\u2019s body, a projection of his mind and spirit, began to flicker. He gazed wide-eyed at his fading self. \u201cIf we can put this much will into Dreadgod madra, we might be able to make a puppet-construct that could fight Monarchs. Do you think we could leave spirits behind that can prevent people from advancing to Monarch?\u201d\n[That\u2019s a great idea! Let\u2019s stay and examine it instead of helping Mercy.]\n\u201cApologies, Mercy.", "e84fbdc5-0fed-4f44-b7ee-3e5921e4b93d": "She finally caught her breath and was proud of herself for adapting, until she looked up to meet the Empress\u2019 eyes.\nThose purple beacons of light were shining on Lindon.\nThe Empress was focused on him, and she had her bow half-drawn.

I was distracted.\u201d\n[No, I was serious, this is way more interesting.]\nMercy forced a smile. \u201cNo, of course! Whatever you need to do.\u201d\nHer spirits had died. Not because Lindon wasn\u2019t helping her\u2014the fact that he was in here at all, giving her insights into her own Book, was more than she could have asked\u2014but because of how much help she still needed.\nLindon noticed. \u201cForgiveness, please. I shouldn\u2019t have lost concentration.\u201d\nThe Empress was still focused on him, but he was ignoring her.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not it, I\u2026\u201d She sighed. \u201cMy mother left memories about what it took for her Herald advancement, when she was becoming a Monarch. It was terrifying. Her Remnant almost killed her, and she almost killed it. The spiritual damage was so bad that she took months to recover, even after her advancement.\u201d\n\u201cWe can help you with that,\u201d Lindon said confidently.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying! You didn\u2019t need this much help. I\u2019ve had someone holding my hand since I was a girl.\u201d\nShe paced and fretted, but continued speaking, baring her soul while standing in the depths of her spirit. \u201cAt first, it was easy. I was just better than everyone else. And then, when I\u2019d proven myself, I had a Sage and a Herald teaching me. My mother\u2019s a Monarch! And still, you and Yerin\u2014\u201d\n\u201cEithan turned out to be the Reaper of Worlds,\u201d Lindon pointed out.\nMercy hesitated. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026that\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201d\nLindon folded his arms and walked in front of Mercy, turning his back on the Empress. She looked furious and redoubled the force of her glare, but Lindon didn\u2019t flinch. His body did start flickering more rapidly, though.\n\u201cI have received more help than anyone in the universe. Even most of my power is stolen. There\u2019s nothing noble about doing everything yourself. You just have to do your best to honor the help you\u2019ve gotten.\u201d\nThen he stepped out of the way and continued, \u201cWe want you to persuade your mother into ascending.\u201d\nMercy stared at the Empress that represented her mother\u2019s ideal self. Even with most of her attention taken up by Lindon, she was still intimidating.\n\u201cShe won\u2019t,\u201d Mercy said certainly.\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll have to kill her.\u201d\nThat shook her, though it wasn\u2019t anything she didn\u2019t already know.\nLindon spoke earnestly. \u201cWill you be happy if you didn\u2019t try?\u201d\nShe wouldn\u2019t.\nHer Archlord revelation had been \u2018To bring light.\u2019 To bring light, she had to at least try carrying a torch into the deepest darkness.\nMercy squared her shoulders and faced down the Empress. \u201cI\u2019ll need work.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re here for,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cWe won\u2019t leave you by yourself until you\u2019re\u2014\u201d\nLindon vanished.\nMercy and Dross both stared at the space where he had just stood.\n[Was that a joke?] Dross asked. [You know I don\u2019t understand your humor. Lindon?]\n\u201cGo check, Dross,\u201d Mercy ordered.\nDross disappeared. Maybe Lindon had been joking. The timing was suspicious. But that hadn\u2019t looked like he\u2019d left voluntarily. The Empress certainly hadn\u2019t shoved him out.\nEither the Book had activated a self-defense mechanism they\u2019d never seen before, or something had pulled Lindon away.\nWith Lindon gone, the full force of the Empress\u2019 attention was on Mercy, but now it was an annoying distraction. Weight gathered on Mercy\u2019s mind and spirit, trying to force her down, to make her submit.\nMercy glared back at the Empress. \u201cNot now!\u201d\nFor a moment, the pressure retreated.\nDross popped back in, flying in panicked circles.

He disappeared!]\nMercy wasn\u2019t ready to panic just yet. \u201cDidn\u2019t he just leave?\u201d\nDross grabbed Mercy by the collar. [Mercy, he cannot get so far that I can\u2019t sense him without going through a portal. And he can\u2019t do that. Either the labyrinth brought him somewhere without him giving an order, or someone took him.]\nThere were only a handful of beings in the world capable of taking Lindon anywhere against his will, and none of them would find it easy.\nIf they took him, they were prepared for him.\nMercy shrugged off the Empress again and shed the Book, returning to herself in a dark room.\nShe stretched her own spiritual awareness out. Dross couldn\u2019t sense as far as she could; at least, her version of Dross.\nTo her surprise, she found Lindon immediately.\nThat wasn\u2019t good news.\nEveryone on the planet could probably feel Lindon at that moment. He was surrounded by enough power to shake the fabric of the world.\n\u201cContact Yerin and Ziel,\u201d Mercy told Dross. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving.\u201d\n[Where do I tell them we\u2019re going?]\n\u201cWe have to see my mother.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nLindon hadn\u2019t been torn through space so violently since the Uncrowned King tournament. He slammed back into reality, bracing himself before he fell to the sand. Then he took stock of his situation.\nHe was in the center of a vast wasteland. Besides himself and Dross, there were only three living things for miles.\nThe ground was rocky, the terrain mountainous. And the sky a crackling, chaotic swirl of gold and red.\nLindon\u2019s spiritual sense burned with the power around him. He suspected everyone could sense this gathering, because no one had bothered to veil themselves.\nA titanic egg made from the Bleeding Phoenix sat in the distance like a dormant building, cracks suggesting it was about to hatch. A red-winged human avatar of the Dreadgod had been formed from blood madra and stood nearby. She gave him a wave and a smile when he arrived.\nThe Wandering Titan loomed over them both. It glared down with its eyes above the clouds, and the weight of its attention caused the grains of sand to shimmy and dance in panicked circles.\nReigan Shen lowered the binding of Subject One, which had been worked into what appeared to be some kind of horn.\nLindon could feel its influence. That horn had brought him here. Combined with King\u2019s Key madra and the wills of a Monarch and two Dreadgods, the horn had established enough authority over him to haul him through space. Despite his metaphysical weight.\nWary, Lindon wondered what else that Dreadgod weapon could do.\nReigan Shen was visibly struggling in this company, and while he shot Lindon a smug look, Lindon suspected he\u2019d rather be anywhere else.\n\u201cBrother,\u201d the Bleeding Phoenix said. \u201cLet\u2019s talk.\u201d\nLindon\u2019s right arm lurched, but he forced it back down. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cI should have thought that would be obvious,\u201d Shen said. \u201cWe went through great difficulty to bring you here. If you\u2019re not willing to talk, we\u2019ll have to turn to a more violent course of action.\u201d\nTime slowed as Lindon consulted with Dross.\nHe should have been afraid, but the hunger was so strong he could no longer hold it back. The three enemies in front of him looked like delicious meals to a starving man.\nA burden slid off Lindon\u2019s back.\nHe wanted to bring the others along with him.

He had never dreamed of becoming the strongest alone.\nBut helping them along meant being responsible for them, and he was sick of worry. Now, the enemies had cornered him and forced him to fight. He almost welcomed it.\nThe only one he had to worry about was himself.\n[And me!] Dross pointed out. [But don\u2019t worry, I have plenty of worry to go around.]\nFueled by hunger, Lindon\u2019s rage returned. Reigan Shen had locked the others away in a pocket dimension. He had tried to kill them, more than once. And now he was right there.\nNot a blink had passed since Shen stopped talking when Lindon lunged for him.\nThe Titan was the first to respond, summoning spires of stone from the ground beneath Lindon\u2019s feet, but Lindon crashed through the cage without slowing down. He clawed for Shen with his right hand, and Shen\u2019s automated defenses were too late. Constructs projected shields, but they only slowed Lindon.\nWhite fingers had almost seized Shen around the throat, but blood madra lunged up like an attacking shark to take a bite out of Lindon\u2019s middle.\nHe blasted the Bleeding Phoenix\u2019s attack away with an Empty Palm that projected a blue-white handprint bigger than his body. But that distraction gave Shen enough space to fly away, spitting half-formed words that Lindon suspected were Rosegold curses.\n\u201cHe\u2019s not to be eaten,\u201d the Phoenix\u2019s human body admonished Lindon. A flock of Blood Shadows in the shapes of birds screeched from high overhead.\nThe Wandering Titan redoubled its pressure, pushing Lindon down, but Lindon matched his will to the Titan\u2019s. The air between them shivered and trembled, even starting to crack.\n\u201cAnd why not?\u201d Lindon asked politely.\n\u201cHe can\u2019t be touched,\u201d the Phoenix said, as though it were obvious.\n\u201cAh. The binding gives him authority over you.\u201d Lindon\u2019s right hand flexed at the thought of Consuming Subject One\u2019s core binding.\nHe and Dross had thought the Horn might be used to control Dreadgods\u2014it could already pull him through space\u2014but they hadn\u2019t been sure how much effort it would take Lindon to resist.\nLindon himself had part of his body made from the Slumbering Wraith, and he controlled the labyrinth. It would have been surprising for such a leash to work on him at all, but there was nothing like a field test.\n\u201cKill him!\u201d Shen ordered, but there was no authority behind the word. It seemed he wasn\u2019t strong enough to perform a working on two Dreadgods at once.\nSo, rather than a leash, it seemed his \u2018control\u2019 was more like a gentle suggestion.\nThe Phoenix\u2019s human form glanced at him, but she smiled at Lindon instead. \u201cHe\u2019s irritating, I know. Why fight him when there\u2019s plenty of prey for all of us?\u201d\nShe raised a hand, and projected light in the image of five land masses, each with a different symbol. Iceflower, Rosegold, Everwood, Ninecloud, and Ashwind.\n\u201cYou know how hard it is to keep the hunger under control,\u201d she said. \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s worse when you have no sense of self. You just want to eat, and eat, and eat\u2026but then what would be left? It would be far better to manage the herd.\u201d\nThe continents all turned different colors. Iceflower turned yellow, Rosegold turned blue, Everwood turned white, Ninecloud turned red, and Ashwind turned black.\n\u201cHow about we share?\u201d the Phoenix suggested.\nThe Wandering Titan\u2019s pressure lessened, and Lindon got the impression that it agreed. This was advantageous for the Titan, after all; it was the slowest of the Dreadgods and thus couldn\u2019t cover as much territory.\nThe red-winged woman leaned toward Lindon, radiating honesty. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep the human population stable.", "d1a089c1-01b3-4985-ac68-b5e8015ee597": "Iceflower, Rosegold, Everwood, Ninecloud, and Ashwind.\n\u201cYou know how hard it is to keep the hunger under control,\u201d she said. \u201cTrust me, it\u2019s worse when you have no sense of self.

Just enough Monarchs to sustain us, but each restrained not to threaten us. The mortals can be bent to producing food for us, and in return, we can remain docile. Content. Rather than monsters, we can be guardians.\u201d\n[It\u2019s not that it couldn\u2019t work,] Dross allowed.\nLindon saw the logic. If they continued this way, the Silent King and the Slumbering Wraith would be reborn. Lindon would lose his bow but would replace Subject One permanently.\nIf the intelligent population of the world worked together, they could keep the Dreadgods fed with minimal loss of life. Excess dream energy could be funneled to the Silent King, livestock for the Bleeding Phoenix, unintelligent spirits and extra madra for the Weeping Dragon. Even aura could be funneled more efficiently to create rich natural treasures to feed the Wandering Titan.\nThe Phoenix moved the image of Ashwind forward, waving a hand to its black expanse. \u201cYou could have your home continent all to yourself. Rule it as you wish. If you can keep your hunger under control, you don\u2019t need to tax the people at all. Though you would need to feed a certain amount to stay conscious, of course.\u201d\nLindon could already see the systems and rules that would need to be put into place. \u201cYou\u2019ve put quite a bit of thought into this. Although\u2026I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but isn\u2019t \u2018offering tribute to our guardians\u2019 just a nicer way to say, \u2018feeding immortal monsters so they don\u2019t kill us all\u2019?\u201d\nThe Wandering Titan rumbled with anger, which was much more intimidating when it physically shook the ground. Cracks opened in the stone.\nIn contrast, the Bleeding Phoenix smiled wider. \u201cHow is that worse than what the Monarchs have already done? If we can expend less energy, just rest and stay conscious, I would say we\u2019d make better rulers than they ever did.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t disagree,\u201d Lindon said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m getting rid of you all.\u201d The Hollow Domain expanded around Lindon, a transparent blue-white dome of energy that covered him from every direction. \u201cForgiveness, but I was taught to be very thorough when cleaning.\u201d\nReigan Shen tried to say something, but he was blown backward by the pressure emanating from the Dreadgods. The Phoenix\u2019s laughter shook the skies and sounded more and more like the screech of a bird, while the Titan radiated crushing gravity.\n\u201cYou should have learned to play the odds,\u201d Shen shouted over the chaos.\nLindon looked him in the eye. \u201cYou think I wasn\u2019t prepared for this?\u201d\nThe reborn Wavedancer leaped from his soulspace.\nIts blade shone gold and white, like the surface of a thunderbolt. It was surrounded by a corona of blue sparks and heralded by a storm. Storm-clouds gathered overhead.\nFour copies of Wavedancer spread out to the left, Forged from the Weeping Dragon\u2019s madra. Then four more, to the right.\nLindon joined his spirit to the Weeping Dragon sword formation, and the pressure coming from him was enough to hold his own against the two Dreadgods.\nThen he released his new Dreadgod weapon.\nA white halo exploded over his head, stretching to titanic proportions. Dross cackled madly as he felt his capacity expand. This was really Dross\u2019 weapon.\nLindon had left the bow behind, but he wanted to keep some of its abilities.\nNot every construct needed a binding.

Now that time flowed normally, their entrance through the doorway was far smoother.\n\u201cI\u2019ll need to be stronger if I want my mother to listen to me,\u201d Mercy said. \u201cI\u2019ve absorbed enough of her power that I\u2019m stronger than I should be, but I\u2019m not at the peak. What do we have that can get me there?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a question for Lindon,\u201d Ziel said. He looked grim, as though he thought they were doomed without Lindon\u2019s help.\nMercy\u2019s worry for Lindon only made the situation more urgent. \u201cDross, what do you think?\u201d\nHer Dross spun out, taking exaggerated deep breaths. [Worried? I\u2019m not worried. I\u2019m perfectly calm.]\n\u201cNo one asked if you were worried,\u201d Orthos pointed out.\n[Good. That\u2019s because I\u2019m calm.] Dross turned to regard Mercy. [Your body, spirit, and mind are perfectly suited for advancement. Not just from birth, but because of your Book. What you\u2019ve absorbed from breaking down the pages will get you to Herald, if you can digest it. So what we need\u2026] Dross drifted closer to Ziel. [\u2026is time.]\nZiel stared into the distance, no doubt focused on his spiritual sense, which Mercy could feel prodding around his own spirit. \u201cLindon never figured out how to fully repair the Array. It\u2019s patched up a little, but if I push it here, it won\u2019t be much good in a fight.\u201d\n\u201cDo it,\u201d Mercy said. \u201cA Herald is worth more to us now than another weapon.\u201d Especially since the Herald in question was her; she needed to be able to trade blows with her mother, just in case.\nThough she hoped it wouldn\u2019t come to that.\nZiel shrugged. \u201cAll right. Should be easier to do now that we\u2019re connected to normal time. Dross, can you put her to sleep?\u201d\n[I can, yes. I can. That is something I can do.]\nThey all looked in his direction. Little Blue smacked him on the back.\n[Ow! Stop! You\u2019re not six inches tall anymore!] He looked around and sighed. [Mercy won\u2019t be absorbing elixirs. She\u2019ll be actively breaking down and integrating her mother\u2019s power. She can adapt to it while sleeping, but for most of this time, she has to be conscious.]\nMercy stopped on her way to the shadow aura cycling room. Even with her newfound resolve, that thought made her shudder. \u201cHow long?\u201d\n[A month or two, minimum. Maximum? More like a year.] Dross raised an arm. [Don\u2019t worry! I\u2019ll be with you the whole time!]\n\u201cWe could start with a week,\u201d Ziel said hesitantly, \u201cbut stopping and starting puts a greater burden on the Array. If we end up having to go a whole year, we\u2019ll need to do multiple months at a time.\u201d\nEven a week alone in a script, nothing but Dross and her Book to keep her company, terrified Mercy. It was like locking herself in a coffin.\nCould she do that? If she did, could she stay sane?\nSomething whispered to her that she could. A distant sound that she had begun hearing while she fought to save House Arelius. If this was what it took to help, she could carry this burden.\nAnd besides, Lindon would have done it.\nLittle Blue ran up and threw her arms around Mercy. She shook her head rapidly, telling Mercy not to go.\nThat almost broke Mercy\u2019s determination, but she patted Little Blue on the back of the head and looked to Ziel.\n\u201cStart with a week.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nMercy sat cross-legged in the seventh page of the Book of Eternal Night. Her will and her spirit suffused the battlefield around her, and the world quaked.\nShe couldn\u2019t dismantle the space as cleanly as Lindon could. But she\u2019d practiced plenty.\nChunks of will, flickering memories, and dense shadow madra flowed through her. Dross helped her sort the thoughts while the rest soaked into her spirit.\nAll the while, the spiritual pressure of the Netherworld Empress weighed her down. Now, she felt texture in the makeup of the technique that she had never recognized before. She\u2019d even sampled some of the wishes that Malice had woven into the seventh page.\nHer successor should understand the depth of shadow madra, so the spirit of the Netherworld Empress reflected the Shadow Icon.\nHer successor should feel the burden of rule, so the Netherworld Empress wore the nobility of the Crown Icon.\nHer successor should fight with power unparalleled, so the body of the Netherworld Empress carried the Strength Icon.", "e96ebf10-82ea-4aa4-ac36-ca91549ce774": "She couldn\u2019t dismantle the space as cleanly as Lindon could.

She knew Akura Malice at a level she had never imagined, to the point that it was almost easier to know what Malice would do than to predict herself.\nAnd all that insight led her to one conclusion.\nMercy did not want the same things her mother did.\nShe opened her eyes and watched the Netherworld Empress as the seventh page dissolved around her. Stern, domineering purple eyes met hers.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Mercy whispered.\nShe thought the Empress nodded. Then the page broke down, and the remaining pieces of Malice\u2019s greatest technique flowed into her daughter.\nFor another time, Mercy couldn\u2019t tell how long, she sat in darkness. She strengthened her spirit with the power of Malice, aided by the elixirs she had prepared for this purpose. Her mind spun for a while with stolen thoughts, but Dross helped keep her head clear.\n[Not so bad!] Dross said encouragingly. [I would never, ever wish to do that again, and if I could go back, I would stop you from doing it. But it could have been worse!]\nThe world around Mercy was dark with shadow aura, but she had a greater understanding of the shadow aspect than ever before. Within the darkness, she could see the outlines of her friends. Standing outside the circle of spinning silver runes, waiting for her.\nMercy took a moment to stand and adjust her condition before she strode out of the script.\nA sweating Ziel gasped as he felt her leave, immediately cutting off the Grand Oath Array. He staggered out of the cycling room and collapsed, leaning against the outside of the cave. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026know how\u2026you did that\u2026\u201d he managed to say.\n[I don\u2019t know how Ziel did it either,] Dross put in. [The Grand Oath Array is not in good shape.]\n\u201cHow long was I in there?\u201d Mercy asked softly.\n[This last time was six months. Without me, you wouldn\u2019t have made it. If you weren\u2019t an Archlady, you wouldn\u2019t have made it.] Dross considered. [Actually, I didn\u2019t think you were going to make it at all.]\nThat was her third session inside the Grand Oath Array. Each longer than the last.\nMercy nodded along as Orthos and Little Blue looked to her in concern. For them, it had only been hours.\nShe knew what Malice would do in this scenario. At this point, acting like her mother was second nature. Dross\u2019 model of Malice was more accurate than ever, though of course it was based on Malice as she had been when she\u2019d created the Book of Eternal Night.\nMalice would nod to each of those who supported her and act like what she\u2019d done was nothing. Of course she had exceeded expectations. She was Akura Malice.\nMercy considered how she felt.\nThen she threw herself into Orthos\u2019 arms and started bawling. \u201cThat was terrible! I missed you all so much!\u201d\nOrthos shifted uncomfortably, but he still patted her once. Then a second time.\nTouched by the effort, Mercy cried harder.\nWith one hand, she grabbed Little Blue and pulled her closer. The spirit was crying harder than Mercy herself was.\nOut of the corner of blurry eyes, Mercy saw Ziel shuffle slowly away.\nWhen the moment passed, Mercy sniffled and wiped away tears. \u201cAll\u2014\u201d She sniffed again. \u201cAll right. I guess it\u2019s time to advance, huh?\u201d\nThe instant she stopped crying, Orthos released her and took a step back. \u201cYes. Your spirit is strong.

We\u2019ll need to do it in the sparring room.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t far away, and she continued talking as they walked. \u201cZiel, would you reinforce the room again?\u201d\nHe peered at the scripts as they entered. \u201cWe made this to handle Yerin.\u201d\nThat thought drew Mercy\u2019s spiritual perception to Yerin, who had already been in Ghostwind Hall before any of them. She had activated the eighth Path of Heaven, and was even now meditating in front of it, trying to squeeze out some last-minute insights.\nAlthough it didn\u2019t feel like Yerin was in front of the Path. It felt like she was right on top of it. Inside it. Swallowed up by a cavern of death.\nMercy wrenched her thoughts away from Yerin and back onto her own struggles. Yerin could handle herself.\n\u201cStrengthen the scripts once more, please,\u201d Mercy said. \u201cAnd when the time comes, I would appreciate any protective workings you could give me.\u201d\n[The strength of the Dragon Icon would help too,] Dross suggested to Orthos.\nOrthos\u2019 wrinkles deepened as he frowned. \u201cIs it such a risk?\u201d\n[We saw the memory of Malice\u2019s advancement to Herald. Well, Monarch, since she started as a Sage. Her fight with her Remnant\u2026Oh, I could show you!]\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Mercy said. \u201cThousands died.\u201d\nOrthos folded his arms. \u201cI have seen death.\u201d\n\u201cMy mother lost control. Her Remnant began torturing and killing innocent people just to hurt her.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Orthos reached down for a pile of rocks that had been left strategically in the corner of the room and popped one into his mouth, chewing loudly.\nLittle Blue shuddered.\nShining green symbols wrapped the room, and Ziel glanced back at her. \u201cThat was her Remnant. You think yours will be the same?\u201d\n\u201cHer power is mine now,\u201d Mercy said softly.\nJudiciously, Ziel added another ring of script.\nThere wasn\u2019t much else to do. Once her spirit was prepared and at the peak of Archlord, Mercy sat in the center of yet another script-circle, this one etched on metal plates and much smaller. Only enough for her and the Remnant.\nWhen it fought her, it would break through, but this should at least slow it down.\n[I have a model for its fighting patterns, based on your mother\u2019s Remnant,] Dross said. [And at least you have reliable backup!]\nMercy smiled over the other four as they gave her encouraging looks. Ziel\u2019s looked the same as ever, but the rest were clearly trying to empower her with their gaze.\n\u201cBe safe,\u201d Ziel commanded.\n\u201cBe strong,\u201d Orthos ordered.\nThe strength of the Dragon Icon and the hardiness of the Shield Icon covered Mercy, flowing through her.

Her mother\u2019s Remnant had used lies and illusions to deceive Malice, even tricking Malice into killing some of her own descendants.\n\u201cI am the original,\u201d Mercy said firmly. \u201cYou are my Remnant, and you will serve my will.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever I can do to help!\u201d\nThe Remnant held out a hand with rounded, stubby fingers.\nMercy hesitated. Against her better judgment and her mother\u2019s instincts, she said, \u201cAre you\u2026Are you sure?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to do something hard, aren\u2019t you? It makes you sad.\u201d The Remnant patted her chest. \u201cI want to help you.\u201d\nIt hadn\u2019t been long since Mercy stopped crying, but tears welled up in her eyes again. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nThe Remnant beamed. \u201cDon\u2019t give up, Mercy! We\u2019ll do this together!\u201d\nThen the spirit flowed back into Mercy, weaving through her body. Archlord soulfire supported the process, and Mercy could feel herself changing.\nBut not very much.\nIn the end, the only obvious change she kept was her hair. It floated like a gas, or like it was drifting through water. The same sort of hair Uncle Fury had. And her mother.\nWhen she was finished, Mercy stood up and brushed off her knees. \u201cWell, uh\u2026I made it!\u201d\nOrthos and Ziel watched her with flat looks.\nLittle Blue cheered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nMalice gazed into the shadows of Fate.\nThe future was always difficult to see, represented only in silhouettes of what was to come. Details could be gleaned by impression and interpretation, but generally the circumstances surrounding the futures she glimpsed were a mystery.\nNow, it was foggier than ever.\nThe Dreadgods loomed large in every direction she looked. Even when they died soon\u2014which was a disturbingly likely possibility\u2014they still ruled over the destiny of the world for years to come.\nLindon was the same. She could see his broad shadow looming in every direction. Even, perhaps especially, when he died.\nSo many complex factors and relationships made the right path difficult to spot. There was no outcome where she didn\u2019t lose something.\nAt least, no outcome she could see. Which was why she kept looking.\nShe felt the battle between Dreadgods play out, as she\u2019d foreseen. There was virtually no future in which Lindon didn\u2019t go to war against the others. The trick now was to prevent him from winning.\nGoing to the battlefield herself was out of the question. He\u2019d already forced Northstrider to advance. Malice did not participate in fights she couldn\u2019t win.\nBut she could see her daughter in her immediate future.

Mercy is on her way here. Split her off from her friends and send her here.\u201d\nThe Sage of the Silver Heart did not respond directly, but Malice sensed her acceptance. And her reluctance.\nMalice would have to reassure Charity soon. For a woman who had awakened the Heart Icon, Charity\u2019s heart was too easily swayed. But that was likely to cause only minor problems in the immediate future, and Malice could handle Charity before she became a more serious obstacle in years to come.\nShe\u2019d prefer to nail down her granddaughter\u2019s loyalty immediately, but that was the problem with living in apocalyptic times. The world-ending crises had to be solved first.\nMalice moved through shadow to the audience chamber of this dark castle and arranged herself on her throne. She adopted a stern attitude and filled the space with the pressure of her will. The presence of an empress.\nShe was not pleased with her daughter, and Mercy should feel that as soon as she arrived.\nThat was soon enough. Darkness passed over, and Mercy came stumbling out of the shadow. She glanced around for a moment as she realized she was alone with her mother.\nMercy didn\u2019t fall to her knees immediately, as Malice had expected. She focused more sharply on her daughter.\nThis time, Mercy did fall to one knee and bow her head. \u201cMother. Will you speak to me for a moment?\u201d\nMalice let her displeasure into her voice. \u201cThe first words out of your mouth should have been to beg for my forgiveness.\u201d\n\u201cWill you help us defeat the Dreadgods?\u201d\nMercy lifted her head and gave an earnest plea.\nFor a moment, Malice was stunned. That was more spine than she had expected out of her compassionate daughter.\nBut that resolve was aimed in the wrong direction. Malice gave a scornful laugh. \u201cOf course not! Don\u2019t you see how much suffering the world has endured since the tournament? I wasn\u2019t the one who made it that way! That was your friends.\u201d\nMercy nodded. \u201cIt has been bad. But we can make it better!\u201d\n\u201cCan you even comprehend how many people have lost their lives? The world was better before all this chaos.\u201d\n\u201cBetter for who?\u201d\nMalice was tired of all this back-and-forth. In fact, her anger burned hotter than she expected.\nWith Strings of Shadow, she grabbed her daughter and slammed her to the floor. \u201cWhy do you think you understand anything? You want me to bow to an ignorant child because he has stolen the power of the Dreadgods? I was ruling the world before his grandfather was born!\u201d\nMalice had begun raising her voice, but so what? It felt good to scream, and she deserved it. \u201cYou think I wanted to leave the Dreadgods around? You think I like risking my life to push them away whenever they act up, for the sake of Golds who don\u2019t even know who I am? I hate them! But this is the world, Mercy! Wake up!\u201d\nThe world rippled with the force of that last command. It wasn\u2019t quite a Sage working, but Malice\u2019s will was strong enough that it almost became one.

Where did that get you? I should have taught you a more lasting lesson.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I had done it sooner. I ran away because I was afraid of you, but I never realized how much you needed me. Let me tell you what everyone else is afraid to say.\u201d Mercy took a deep breath, and Malice prepared to slap her into the next room depending on what words came out of her mouth.\n\u201cMother, you sound evil.\u201d\nMalice blinked.\n\u201cAre you listening to yourself?\u201d Mercy went on. \u201c\u2018I should have taught you a more lasting lesson,\u2019 \u2018You should have begged for my forgiveness,\u2019 talking about how no one should stand up to you\u2026Mother, I feel like you\u2019re going to toss me into an active volcano.

It slid aside, and she began to laugh. As though she\u2019d been waiting for that moment, Mercy joined her.\nThey laughed together for a long minute, and Malice enjoyed the sensation. She even wiped a single tear from her eye. \u201cI may have gotten carried away,\u201d she admitted. \u201cYou speak as a queen for too long and it tends to linger on the tongue.\u201d\nMercy was beaming. \u201cYou see? We can still talk about things! I know a lot has happened recently, but we can get through it together.\u201d Mercy hurried up to Malice\u2019s throne, and Malice stepped down to meet her.\n\u201cAscend, Mother,\u201d Mercy urged her. She took Malice\u2019s hands. \u201cWe\u2019ll go together! Take the whole family along!\u201d\nMalice was still annoyed by the topic, so she tried to tug one hand away, but her daughter held on. Malice raised an eyebrow. \u201cLook how far you\u2019ve come, holding on to me. But I still intend to stay here. I won\u2019t be chased out of my kingdom by anyone.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to fight you, Mother. Even Lindon doesn\u2019t. He wanted me to come here and resolve things peacefully.\u201d\nOf course he did. He might be able to crush her with raw strength, but that didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t do some damage first. Power only became leverage when you knew how to use it.\nMalice sighed. \u201cI know what you think of me, and I know I may tend to be spiteful and a touch\u2026tyrannical. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m wrong. Let me return this to you, Mercy: revolution always costs blood. Do you know how many people will die in this change of the world?

She turned her hands around to grab Mercy\u2019s. \u201cMost of them, I will take prisoner.\u201d\nSlowly, Malice saw steel fill up her daughter.

That wouldn\u2019t be enough to hold Yerin\u2014it was hard enough to capture an average Herald, much less one with her unique advantages\u2014but Charity\u2019s techniques were suited to the role of jailer.\nSilver Heart madra would put Yerin to sleep. She had some mental enhancements, but Charity could overcome them with the aid of the script formation in the cell. Then Charity would kill her.\nMalice had seen it play out in Fate already. When she killed Yerin, Lindon would come for revenge. She needed hostages for that situation.\nIt was a delicate balance, and not ideal, but Malice was certain it was her best plan.\nBarring some of the unpredictable variables.\nTears glistened in Mercy\u2019s eyes, and despite everything, Malice did feel some sympathy for her daughter. The girl was still very young.\n\u201cThat was your last chance, Mother,\u201d Mercy whispered. \u201cI wish you\u2019d taken it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nThe future warped around Malice.\nShe found herself once again in the World of Night, looking into the future. What had once been an insignificant, flickering shadow now loomed large. An obstacle standing in her way.\nAn owl.\nWhile Malice consulted the future, she distantly felt her hands wrenched apart by Mercy\u2019s Herald strength. The World of Night fell away, leaving Malice staring into her daughter\u2019s sad eyes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready, Aunt Charity,\u201d Mercy whispered.\nSword-and-blood madra swelled, and one wall of Malice\u2019s castle exploded inward. Yerin strode in, sword in her hand glowing with her Enforcer technique. Her eyes, so much like Fury\u2019s, blazed red.\nThe dragon-turtle and the Sylvan Riverseed, both in human form, walked beside her. They would be a hazard.

Dragon\u2019s breath burned molten holes through the hearts of mountains. Clouds of Blackflame aura produced dark tornadoes of flame that scorched the Wandering Titan and affected the weather for miles.\nThat didn\u2019t even take into account those Dreadgod weapons, for which Reigan burned with greed. The shining white halo\u2019s effects were largely unseen, though any Monarch could sense the trades of dream aura that represented a mental battle, but the swords made from the Weeping Dragon were as dramatic as anything else.\nStorm-clouds followed overhead, crackling with lightning. Bloodspawn that spread from the Phoenix wrestled against a rain of animated draconic bolts, and thick lightning of concentrated aura hammered the Titan. The swords themselves flashed against the Dreadgods, turning attacks with thundering blows that cracked space.\nLindon hadn\u2019t even used the Weeping Dragon\u2019s breath, though Reigan could sense the binding that would make that possible. He was holding that tactic in reserve, waiting for the opportune moment. Like the Dragon itself had done.\nAll of Reigan Shen\u2019s calculations and predictive artifacts suggested that Lindon would lose. It would be a difficult battle, but he couldn\u2019t stand up to the combined might of the Dreadgods.\nBut no one knew better than Reigan Shen how the future could shift, and there were too many factors altering Fate to be certain of anything. When he observed with his own eyes, Lindon\u2019s victory was a disturbing possibility.\nHe wasn\u2019t pressuring the other Dreadgods, of course, but he was matching them evenly. A horrifying feat.\nReigan himself had intended to join the fight, but he had the sharp and uncomfortable premonition that Lindon was waiting for that.\nNot only was there little room to intervene without risking a hit, Reigan felt something suspicious about the way Lindon fought.\nHere and there, Lindon\u2019s spiritual sense flickered closer to Reigan. His eyes would pass that direction for just a moment as he flew to dodge a Dreadgod\u2019s attack.\nReigan Shen knew he was under observation.\nCenturies of instinct warned him not to make a move. That could have been a trick. Perhaps the Silent King\u2019s Crown allowed Lindon to intimidate Monarchs without being detected, but Reigan didn\u2019t think so. This was likely just his gut warning him that if he intervened in the battle, Lindon would find a way to crush him between Dreadgods.\nUnfortunately, his gut was also warning him of something worse.\nThe Dreadgods couldn\u2019t travel through space very far, not without a great expenditure of resources or tools like the Wraith Horn, but they had grown faster as they grew in intelligence and power. In a fight like this one, even the Wandering Titan was an earth-shaking blur.\nOr, in this case, an ocean-churning blur.\nTheir battle covered miles every second, as Lindon and the Bleeding Phoenix lit up the clouds with their techniques while the Wandering Titan dashed along and provided heavy hits from below. They were now far from the mainland of the Iceflower continent and still moving quickly.\nToward Rosegold.\nReigan\u2019s home.\nThe distance between continents was not negligible, even taking into account direct spatial transportation, but Rosegold and Iceflower were closer than most. Once, they had been linked.\nCrossing the ocean between them was still a significant journey, but Lindon and the Dreadgods could cover a lot of ground. And it wasn\u2019t unusual for Dreadgod battles to last for days.\nBefore tomorrow, they would hit the coast of Rosegold.

He was looking down on Monarchs, and had snatched prey from Reigan\u2019s mouth. The entire world had seen how Reigan Shen did all the work for a human boy to reap the benefits.\nThen, the world had literally watched as Tiberian\u2019s Underlord advisor had revealed himself to be a world-destroying threat.\nReigan\u2019s fear had far outweighed his anger, but that didn\u2019t mean that he had forgotten his pride. Eithan had been laughing at him behind his back for years. Lindon had learned from his master. Now, even the Dreadgods\u2014the rampaging beasts that Reigan had corralled like rabid dogs for so many years\u2014were spitting in his face.\nReigan Shen had been made the butt of the joke too many times.\nHe was not a housecat.

At the same time, he was striking against the Titan\u2019s tail with flying swords, hitting its building-sized punch with his own human-sized one, keeping the Phoenix at bay with sweeps of dragon\u2019s breath, and wrestling for aura control over a ten-mile area. All while flying and switching between cores.\nReigan Shen was not a welcome addition. There was a limit to how much Lindon could juggle.\nStill, as threats went, Shen was not at the top of Lindon\u2019s list.\nDross\u2019 alarm flared as the Monarch opened a gate to the spear he\u2019d used to attack Sacred Valley before. Lindon had thought that weapon had been destroyed by Ozmanthus, but obviously he\u2019d been wrong.\n\u201cClose!\u201d Lindon ordered the King\u2019s Key portal.\nReigan\u2019s will only kept the gate wobbling for a second or two before it was crushed beneath Lindon\u2019s working.\nThat would slow him down for a while, but Lindon paid a price for it.\nOne of the Phoenix\u2019s techniques\u2014a hammer-blow of blood and force madra\u2014slammed into Lindon from above. It launched him into the sea like a falling star, and water from the impact blasted into the clouds.\nBefore he could collect himself, the Titan was stomping a foot down on him.\n[Soul Cloak,] Dross suggested, and Lindon agreed.\nBlue-white madra flared around him, seeming almost solid now. He caught the Titan\u2019s foot in both hands.\nWhich was a bit like saying he\u2019d stopped a collapsing roof with a toothpick. Nonetheless, he did it.

Each needle was bigger than his arm and contained enough power to destroy a fortress, and the Bleeding Phoenix was sending him ten thousand.\nHe had to drop the Titan and expand the Hollow Domain to deal with those. Even then, the needles weren\u2019t wiped out until he finished them with an Empty Palm that blotted out the sun.\nLindon remembered slamming the Empty Palm into an Iron\u2019s stomach to win a duel.\nIt had failed him against Li Markuth, the so-called Gold that had come from beyond the world.\nIt was his first, oldest technique.\nNow he was using it against Dreadgods.\n[Look how far you\u2019ve come,] Dross said wistfully. [Now, this is going to be the end of the line, unless someone else has something up their sleeves.]\nLindon was fighting with everything on the line. He was stretching his techniques beyond their limits and had made every weapon he could. This was as far as he could go.\nAnd, if things continued this way, he would eventually lose.\nThat was inevitable.\nNo matter how vast his reserves, no matter how much he replenished himself in the middle of the fight with his right arm, his opponents could do the same.\nLindon\u2019s only chance of survival was to buy enough time for the others to come through. But his real goal was to take one of the Dreadgods down.\nIf he did that, he could call it a victory whether he survived or not.\n[You know I hate to pester you, but\u2026] Purple light drew Lindon\u2019s attention to Reigan Shen again.\nThis time, the Monarch was coming in with a two-handed sword that ran with blood. He was doing something with the Phoenix\u2019s madra, perhaps feeding it to the blade to strengthen it, but Lindon was trying to dodge a technique that bent Fate. He had bigger enemies.\nA slash came in from Reigan Shen, a sweep of madra that erupted at the same time as an attack from the Wandering Titan, and Lindon had to waste extra madra and burn some of his limited soulfire to deal with both.\nLindon\u2019s patience slipped.\nDross, find me an opening.\n[Here. But you know, this is going to shave an hour or two off our maximum time.]\nLindon didn\u2019t care. Getting rid of Reigan Shen was another goal he could accomplish. That would improve the world, even if Lindon wasn\u2019t around to see it.\nDross helped Lindon identify the pinpoint timing. He deflected a falling sword of the Phoenix at just the right moment to cause it to slam into the whipping tail of the Titan.\nThe two attacks clashed, sending black cracks spidering through space and churning the ocean beneath, which created a split-second pause in the battle.\nLindon shot toward Reigan Shen.\nThe Monarch defended with his two-handed sword of blood, but Lindon destroyed the artifact with one Empty Palm from his left hand. His right hand shot for Shen.\nReigan Shen\u2019s defensive constructs activated and forced Lindon back for a moment, but Lindon had already used up the time he\u2019d allotted for himself. He switched to his Blackflame core, activated the Burning Cloak, and slammed a fist down on Shen\u2019s skull.\nBone cracked.\nReigan Shen blasted down through the water and into the stone beneath, but Lindon wasn\u2019t finished.

He knew the Rosegold continent was coming up, but he was boxed in. There were populations north and south of here, and the longest stretch of uninhabited ground was between east and west. Once he reached the coast of Rosegold, he\u2019d try to turn the fight around.\nThough there was only so much he could do.\nHe was back into the fight, shoving a river of blood-red flame into the sky using the Hollow Domain, when he sensed a change in the world.\n[Uh-oh. Hey, I know you don\u2019t want me to keep drawing your attention to Reigan Shen, but I still think you ought to look behind you.]\nLindon was struggling with the weight of an ocean of burning blood, but he still glanced back.\nReigan Shen had returned to his original form.\nA white-and-gold lion leaped out of the ocean, and a roaring image in the sky met him. The Lion Icon.\nIn his natural body, Shen was regal and imposing. A vast white-gold mane that shimmered in the sunlight, a pale pelt with bright highlights. He radiated majesty and strength.\nThe effect was only heightened by his wounds. One of his eyes and the entire side of his face was blackened and burned away, one of his legs had been half-crushed, and scorch marks marred his hide.\nSacred beasts tended to take human bodies because the form resonated with madra more easily, allowing more complex control of techniques. For this, they sacrificed power.\nIt may have been the temporary support of his Icon, but Reigan Shen at the moment felt like a Dreadgod himself. He had given up his weapons, weakened his Path.\nIn return, he gained strength.\nHe kicked off of nothing and vanished, leaping through space.\nLindon\u2019s spiritual sense screamed a warning and he met Reigan Shen\u2019s pounce with a Soul Cloak-powered punch.\nOf course, at the same time, he had to hold off the Titan with nine flying swords and burn a cloud of red poison from the Phoenix.\nDross was just as busy, on an invisible front. The white halo over Lindon\u2019s head flared as Dross sent mental attacks against all three, a flood of dream aura at a scale that temporarily matched the Silent King itself.\nWith Dross distracted, Lindon didn\u2019t know exactly how much time he had left. But he knew he was burning through it too fast.\nIf he had to, he would burn himself down to nothing.\nThe Void Icon approved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nYerin never thought she had underestimated the Monarchs. They were the kings and queens of the world, able to go toe-to-toe with the Dreadgods under the right circumstances.\nBut maybe she had underestimated Malice.\nA dozen blades of shadow the size of towers fell from the sky. They flew over the forests at the eastern end of the Ashwind continent, where the dragons had once ruled. Yerin slashed at one of the Forged swords herself, intending to break the one in her way and continue on to Malice.\nIt wasn\u2019t easy.

The last, Blue had to handle herself.\nAll the arrows came at virtually the same time.\nWhile they were still reeling, an armored Malice appeared next to Orthos. She was human-sized, and he punched at her with the Burning Cloak active, but she absorbed the blow easily and hit him in the chin, ribs, and gut in quick succession.\nThe air exploded with the force and Orthos blasted into the distance.\nStriker techniques from Mercy and Yerin ripped through the space Malice had just occupied, but she was already gone.\nOnce again, she was on top of Little Blue. She brought her bow down on Blue in a two-handed strike. Blue blocked it with crossed arms, but Malice caught her before she could fly into the earth and stabbed another blade of shadow into Little Blue\u2019s gut.\nBlue defended herself with a brief eruption of the Hollow Domain, then Ziel and Mercy forced Malice away, but Yerin could see what was happening.\nSo could Dross.\n[She\u2019s identified the weak link,] Dross observed. [Not that I\u2019m calling Little Blue weak, of course. Just weaker than, uh, she needs to be for this fight.]\nYerin saw that herself. Orthos and Blue might be at the same level, but Orthos had centuries more experience. No matter how many memories Little Blue had absorbed from other spirits, she wasn\u2019t living up to her potential yet.\nWell, it was Blue\u2019s role to learn from this fight. If she survived, she would grow.\nIt was Yerin\u2019s role to make sure they all survived.\nYerin had held herself back to take the stance she needed for the Reaper\u2019s Sword. Now, the Phoenix Song sang through her.\nShe had no trouble building killer intent for this attack. Malice was an easy target to hate.\nThe world flashed black and white as Yerin swung her sword.\nMalice spun around so fast that Yerin didn\u2019t see it, and there was an arrow already nocked to her bow. The Netherworld Empress flashed behind her, and the image of a bow appeared in the sky. The Bow Icon.\nMalice\u2019s arrow met the slash of power from Yerin\u2019s sword. Both were swallowed up.\n[That\u2019s not encouraging. But cheer up! If you were a Monarch, your hit would be better. Maybe. That one was pretty good.]\nWhile Yerin switched back to ordinary techniques to keep Malice under control, Malice had already moved on to another target.\nEven with the numbers advantage, Yerin didn\u2019t see how they could win easily. Malice was an unfair opponent.\nWith her armor, she waded through black dragon\u2019s breath. She had the speed to avoid Mercy\u2019s arrows.

Or shadow.\nThe phantom-puppet erupted in tendrils of shadow that reminded her of Dross, and she had to dodge back to avoid them. Dross showed her what would happen if they touched her; they carried something like a spiritual poison.\nYerin\u2019s frustration grew. She could break this thing, but it was taking far too long.\nIn the meantime, Malice had thrown out constructs to deal with the others. Charity fled from a plodding dark juggernaut, Ziel was under attack from all directions from a swarm of obsidian butterflies, and Mercy faced down something that resembled a shadow of herself.\nMalice focused her personal attack on Little Blue.\n[I can\u2019t simulate all this!] Dross cried. [I\u2019ve never seen these constructs before! I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re made of! She\u2019s a famous Soulsmith, but there are no records of her fighting like Reigan Shen!]\nBut she could.\nYerin couldn\u2019t prove it, but she was stone-certain that Malice had prepared these countermeasures against each of them specifically. It was what Lindon would have done.\nAnd it fit what they knew of Malice to think that she might have plots in place against everyone, even those she thought to be her allies. Or her children.\nLittle Blue was taking a beating. She was hit in the gut, kicked in the side of the head, sent flying and hauled back. Still, she hung in there. An Empty Palm dissolved an arrow, and she caught more and more blows with the Soul Cloak.\nNot that she would last long.\nMalice had everything. She had the defenses of an earth artist, the subtlety of a shadow artist, the strength of a sword artist, the flexibility of a Soulsmith, and the resources of a woman who had ruled most of a continent for hundreds of years.\nSo Yerin needed more.\nThe Phoenix Song sang through her, and she danced to its tune. Red-and-silver madra blazed in her sword.\nShe needed more speed. More power. She needed to react faster. Better.

Everything but four balls of purple\u2026and one red.\nThe Drosses spin around the otherwise-still scenery, five eyes gazing at the situation from every angle.\n[You\u2019re going to like this,] one Dross says happily. [I have great confidence that I can help you survive the next ten seconds.]\nThe future plays out before Yerin\u2019s eyes. Malice launches an arrow at Mercy, which is weakened by a shield from Ziel and breaks on Mercy\u2019s bloodline armor. Little Blue uses a Hollow Domain to disrupt one of Malice\u2019s constructs enough for Orthos to blast it apart with dragon\u2019s breath, and all the while Yerin herself keeps up a barrage of techniques on the Monarch.\n[That\u2019s how long we expect Malice to continue fighting like this before she pulls out another trick,] another Dross says.\nZiel\u2019s voice echoes in Yerin\u2019s mind. Do we know what her other tricks are?\nIf Yerin could move her body, she would jump. Before hearing Ziel, she hadn\u2019t realized the minds of the others were stuck in here with her.\nThe red Dross, hovering by Yerin, shrugs. [I can make some educated guesses.]\nMalice opens a pitch-black void space, from which more constructs of shadow and death boil out. They unfold into incomprehensible shapes, moving to support the other constructs.\nThe image freezes again and reverses. This time, instead of opening her void key, Malice speaks a command that echoes with greater authority than she\u2019d ever shown before. All their techniques disperse, just for an instant, but the enemy constructs take that opening to kill them.\nThe world reverses again, and this time Malice pulls an even more powerful bow from her void key. This one shines bright purple and has a string of darkness.\nMercy gasps. I\u2019ve never seen that bow before!\n[I made it up,] Dross says proudly. [Do you like it? I consider it likely that she has a backup weapon, and it may be stronger than the one she\u2019s using.]\nSo she has more weapons than we thought, Yerin says. If she had hands, she\u2019d tick points off on her fingers. She might have more techniques than we knew. And we don\u2019t know her weaknesses.\nThe red Dross gives her a look of wide-eyed surprise. [Oh, of course we do. She\u2019s outnumbered.]\nAnother Dross moves over to Malice and spreads his tendrils wide. [We have a good understanding of her personality. Now that she\u2019s been betrayed by Charity, she won\u2019t call in anyone else. She\u2019ll take care of this herself. We can wear her down.]\nTime plays again. Yerin sees herself engaging the Monarch alongside the others. Each of them ward off the constructs with most of their attention, every now and then throwing a technique against Malice.\nIt all hinges on Yerin.\nThe Yerin in Dross\u2019 projection engages the Monarch with sharper movements than Yerin had ever shown in reality. She moves like she can see the future.\nYerin tries to shake her head. You rely on me to fight like that, and you\u2019re hanging all our lives on a bad bet. I can\u2019t keep that up for more than a breath and a half.\nShe\u2019d fought Malice before, and that was with Lindon taking up most of the Monarch\u2019s attention. Yerin can\u2019t win while protecting the others.\nAll five Drosses focus their eyes on her.\nOne points at the image of her matching a Monarch blow-for-blow.\n[If you want to win, all you have to do is fight better than you ever have.]\n[We could retreat,] another Dross suggests. [Leaving Malice alone. Free to plot against us. Chase us down.]\nWe have to stop her here, Orthos says gravely.\nMercy says nothing, and in her silence, Yerin hears agreement.\nYou\u2019ll have to leave your lives to me, Yerin says to them all. Can\u2019t say you\u2019re not throwing them away. You have a problem with that, say so now.\nNo one else says anything.\nYerin almost votes against herself.\nThe red Dross claps his tendrils together. [That\u2019s settled. Now, let\u2019s dig through those memories and see how much of a sword artist we can make you in the next five seconds.]", "833a2706-7daf-416a-9857-f7a15f360cbe": "* * *\n\nTo travel the path to victory that Dross saw, Yerin\u2019s timing would have to be perfect.\nShe pushed forward.\nThe Endless Sword formed a cage around Malice. The Monarch crashed through it, as expected, but any impact on her armor would affect her spiritual stability. Yerin followed up with a Rippling Sword that sliced apart the clouds above as Malice dodged, and then Yerin was in range to fight hand-to-hand again.\nYerin\u2019s slashes were a blur even to her own eyes, cutting the air, but Malice could meet every one of them. Her staff turned blows aside, and she could deflect with the backs of her armored hands, her plated shoulders.\nEvery impact between them sent out a blast of cutting wind. Some of the blows felled trees in the jungle down below.\nIt wasn\u2019t enough. Yerin\u2019s moves were still too slow, her timing sloppy. She wasn\u2019t used to fighting with this much power.\nEverything she\u2019d stolen from the Sage and the Herald, the training and elixirs she\u2019d taken in Ghostwind Hall, and the power she took in every second from her hunger technique\u2014all of it combined into a rushing river pushing Yerin forward faster and faster.\nDross gave her suggestions, but she had to feel it. There was an ideal movement, and she could almost taste it. She had danced to that music before.\nThe Phoenix Song began to reach a crescendo, taking on a new tone.\nMemories flashed through Yerin\u2019s mind, and Dross polished them to fresh clarity. Her master, fighting against three opponents at once. Herself at the Uncrowned King tournament, when she had felt the Sword Icon moving through her. The Winter Sage\u2019s precisely timed attacks. Eithan\u2019s absolute strikes against his enemy in the sky, and the Mad King\u2019s savage technique to defend against them.\nMore and more memories, including those she\u2019d taken from dream tablets. Yerin had seen sword artists from Lowgold all the way up to Monarch, and each of them had walked their own Path.\nThey all congealed and began to crystallize.\nLike a true sword artist, Yerin learned as she fought.\nYerin started to feel Malice\u2019s attacks before Dross predicted them. Her Goldsigns took off small chips of Akura bloodline armor. Yerin suffered blows here and there herself\u2014a staff cracking into her bones, or a shadow cutting across one of her madra channels\u2014but she couldn\u2019t feel them. She was listening to the music of battle.\nA connection slipped into place between her and the world. Overhead, a sword began to reveal itself as though clouds were peeling away.\nYerin stumbled back.\nMalice\u2019s attack missed, but only because Yerin shoved herself out of the way at the last second. She wrestled with the power emerging in the sky, trying to disentangle herself from the music, to force her will against the world.\nBleed and bury me, why is it so hard to stop an Icon?\n[Is it? Huh. Lindon didn\u2019t seem to have much trouble stopping his arm, though I guess that wasn\u2019t his Icon. Eithan certainly made it look easy.]\nYerin didn\u2019t think that was a fair contest.\nMalice saw what was happening and gave a ringing laugh. \u201cWhat are you doing? Advance! Face me, Monarch to Monarch! Don\u2019t you want to kill me, Yerin?\u201d\nYerin couldn\u2019t advance here.\nThey were trying to reduce the number of Monarchs in Cradle. She\u2019d be tearing another hole into her own lifeboat.\nIf she advanced, she might have to ascend while Lindon couldn\u2019t.\nWorse, she might have to leave before the Dreadgods were defeated. This might lose them the entire war.\nYerin finally wrestled the Sword Icon down. It vanished.\nAn arrow crashed into Little Blue like a falling star. It carried her all the way to the jungle, where her landing flattened the surrounding trees.\nYerin\u2019s senses were too sharp for her own good. She saw the arrow, long as a spear, that pinned Little Blue to the ground. The fresh Herald screamed, a sound that equally resembled the discordant screech of a flute and a very human wail of pain. Her hands scrambled to pull out the arrow, but spasms of light and pain flickered through her, and she convulsed in agony.\n\u201cToo slow,\u201d Malice said with another laugh.\nTo Yerin, the world turned colorless and very, very quiet.

The student of the Reaper.\nShe had used Penance, the absolute decree of death, to strike down a Monarch.\nShe had learned to imitate Ozriel\u2019s sword strike.\nAnd she remembered her Archlord revelation. It wasn\u2019t to fight monsters. Yerin was meant to kill them.\nIn that silent world, Yerin looked to Malice and saw a monster.\nShe\u2019d been using her anger at Malice, her disgust, for motivation. But that wasn\u2019t what Eithan felt when he swung his scythe. It wasn\u2019t what she had felt when she\u2019d used Penance.\nYerin chose. She decided who needed to die and made it a reality.\nThis wasn\u2019t revenge.\nIt was an execution.\nIn a world that still seemed frozen, Yerin pulled her sword back almost casually. An image in the sky mimicked her movements. Not a sword.\nA vast, black scythe.\n\u201cDie,\u201d Yerin ordered. She brought her sword down in a simple overhand chop.\nAnd at Yerin\u2019s command, the Death Icon descended on Akura Malice.", "db30f271-e3ad-49ba-b4a6-f36621ad6e3c": "27\n\n\n\n\n\nMercy\u2019s attention was ripped away from the dark clone of herself when she felt Little Blue fall.\nBetween Charity\u2019s owls and Dross\u2019 communication, most of their side were coordinated perfectly. Only with that level of cooperation could they stand up against Malice.\nYerin was the only one left out, operating freely. Dross had seen how she would have to slow herself down to match the rest of them, so she was given free rein. He simply took her actions into account when he guided Mercy and the others, but that perfect web had a hole torn into it when Blue was taken out.\nMercy had time for a moment of stunned horror. She hadn\u2019t even seen the shot coming, and neither had Dross.\nThen the world lost all color.\nA deadly icon loomed over them in the sky, and a gut-deep fear shook Mercy\u2019s spirit. Even the puppet-construct meant to copy her flinched and looked up.\nThat dark scythe reminded her of the day the sky had broken.\nThis time, it hovered over Yerin, and Mercy instinctively knew what it meant. Power radiated from Yerin, but it was a flat, colorless power. The absence of sound rather than a symphony. The Death Icon was raising Yerin to Monarch.\nOne simple swing of Yerin\u2019s sword condemned Mercy\u2019s mother to die.\nThere were no outward projections of madra, but to the spiritual sense, there came a massive wave of lethal power incomparable to anything Mercy had sensed from Yerin before. The invisible wave reached Malice instantly.\nDarkness crept over the sky opposite the scythe, and Malice faded to shadow.\nThe executioner\u2019s blade passed through her. To outward appearances, Malice dodged the attack perfectly.\nBut Mercy knew it had cost her. Yerin\u2019s attacks would work.\n[That\u2019s it!] Dross said.\nI know, Mercy replied sadly. The same idea had occurred to her at the same time. She knew how to beat her mother.\nBut there was no time for that. Little Blue\u2019s spirit was fading.\nMercy dodged an arrow from her shadow-self and fired an arrow of her own at the swarm of obsidian butterflies harassing Ziel. The Strings of Shadow she\u2019d packed into the arrow exploded, tying up the construct.\nWithout hesitation, Ziel blasted down toward Little Blue.\nHe could stabilize her, or so Dross claimed. Maybe he couldn\u2019t heal her, but he could help her hang on.\nMercy just had to keep the constructs from interfering.\nThe pressure on her redoubled as she had to take slashes from the butterflies on her armor while trading arrows with her own shadow, but she would win eventually. Her opponents were just constructs, while she was a living sacred artist. She could adapt and change, while they couldn\u2019t.\nBut this was taking her too long.\nYerin took the fight to Malice, and for the first time, Malice was on the back foot. Yerin alone might not be able to defeat her, as a newly advanced Monarch, but Charity had already defeated a construct. Ghostly soldiers harassed Malice and owls dove into her.\nWith the blinding speed of the Burning Cloak, Orthos appeared over Malice\u2019s head. Black-and-red eyes blazed with fury. His right hand was covered in Blackflame claws, and aura trailed from him in a dark ribbon.\nCharity had shut off Malice\u2019s room to escape, so Malice was forced to choose between taking Yerin\u2019s attack or Orthos\u2019.\nShe raised one hand to catch The Dragon Descends on her armored forearm.\nThere came a blinding explosion as Orthos hammered the Monarch into the trees. Mercy doubted anything in this jungle was going to survive their battle.\n[Duck!] Dross called.\nMercy dipped in the air as butterflies flew overhead. She flipped in midair to drive a fist at her opposite.\nThe shadow-clone mirrored her, but it was burning its own substance to keep up with her attacks. It was already beginning to fade to essence. Likewise, the swarm of obsidian butterflies was looking thin after losing so many of its kind on Ziel\u2019s shield and Mercy\u2019s armor. Even tearing their way out of the Strings of Shadow had cost them some members.\nMercy finished off the two constructs and, without any time to waste, opened her void key.\nA powerful aura billowed out, reminding her of Yerin\u2019s Icon. The snarling of a tiger was somewhat weaker.\nLindon hadn\u2019t kept the Silent King Bow with him. He\u2019d left it with her, believing that she could learn to wield it.\nAnd he\u2019d left her the last Penance arrow.\n[You still can\u2019t use the Bow,] Dross told her nervously.

[You remember that, right? You remember what happened last time?]\nMercy thought that proved she could use the Bow, but that wasn\u2019t the weapon she needed now.\nShe withdrew the Penance arrow\u2014its very touch once again scraped at her lifeline\u2014and fitted it to Eclipse, Ancient Bow of the Soulseeker.\nThe dragon head in the center hissed, its violet eyes shining. It was eager to be used.\nDespite everything, Mercy hesitated to pull back the string.\nNot only was she about to shoot her own mother, but loosing this arrow would be the last thing Suu ever did. Eclipse wasn\u2019t built to withstand ammunition like this.\nYerin and Malice had flown far into the distance, their blows tearing apart clouds and creating thunder, but Mercy could still see them clearly. Her heart was in turmoil.\nEagerness thrilled up through her fingers. Not her own. The bow\u2019s.\nSuu wanted this. To test itself against its maker. If this was to be its last action, the weapon exulted in its purpose.\nBefore Mercy\u2019s resolve could slip again, she pulled the string back to her cheek.\nAnd, despite the distance between them, she felt her mother\u2019s attention on her. From far away, she saw Malice\u2019s lips move.\n\u201cRemember,\u201d her mother commanded.\nMercy pushed against the working, but Malice knew her well. She remembered every moment she\u2019d ever spent with her mother. The formal audience where she\u2019d first been introduced to the Monarch. Receiving the Book of Eternal Night. Declaring she was going to run away.\nWhen Malice had given her the encouragement to reach Underlord.\nEmbracing her when the world ended.\nAll those scenes rushed back into Mercy\u2019s mind, and the feelings returned to her heart. Her hand trembled on the strings.\nHelp me, Dross, she whispered.\n[Oh, I am,] he said. He didn\u2019t sound concerned. [I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s better not to oppose a Monarch\u2019s working directly if you don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s more effective to make it work for you.]\nMercy remembered Malice punishing her in front of the entire clan. The horror she\u2019d felt when she realized that Malice had knowingly allowed the Dreadgods to exist, just to preserve her own power. The lies, the manipulation, the betrayal.\nAnd she remembered the echo of Malice that remained in the labyrinth.\nThat woman was a hero. She\u2019d set out to carve her family a place in a world hostile to them. She had created a safe haven for the weak.\nThen she\u2019d let safety make her complacent. She had grown arrogant, and afraid of losing what she had. She lost sight of those she\u2019d been working for.\nMalice had become a poison, harming the very people she set out to save.\nStrength returned to Mercy. She pulled the string back, and she loosed Penance.\nNo matter what, she did not want to do this. The attack gouged a hole in her heart. But when all other options had been exhausted, when all that was left in life was suffering, sometimes death was the only solution left.\nThere was no joy in this attack.

For some reason, she felt like she ought to catch her mother before she hit the ground.\nIt was a ridiculous thought. Mere stone couldn\u2019t hurt a Monarch.\nMercy sped up anyway.\nDross was yelling to her, but Mercy couldn\u2019t hear him. She couldn\u2019t see well, either. Her vision had grown blurry.\nA red-and-black lump appeared in her way.\nMercy tried to fly around, but Yerin caught her.\n\u201cTake a rest, Mercy.\u201d\nMercy blubbered something. She wasn\u2019t even sure what.\n\u201cYou can put that weight down,\u201d Yerin replied. \u201cWasn\u2019t you that did it. Hey.\u201d Yerin snapped her fingers in front of Mercy\u2019s nose.\nBlinking, Mercy looked into red eyes.\nYerin gave a half-smile. \u201cPin this one to my account, all right? I can carry it, true and certain.\u201d\nMercy shook her head. Her mind was in chaos, but she managed to say, \u201cThe\u2026the Remnant\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou can lean that one on me too.\u201d Yerin looked over Mercy\u2019s shoulder and nodded.\nA moment later, Aunt Charity gathered Mercy up in her arms. Her eyes were wet too. \u201cVeil yourself,\u201d Charity whispered.\nMercy did, so she didn\u2019t sense anything when her mother died.\nShe did, however, see the color vanish from the world for just a moment. Then a dim purple light that must have been the Remnant rising. She tried to turn around for battle, but Aunt Charity held on.\nFinally, after a few more sounds, everything went quiet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nLindon felt Yerin advance.\n[This is nothing to worry about!] Dross said desperately. [What a reliable ally we have now, right? Don\u2019t you think? Allies!]\nHe didn\u2019t have the freedom to feel much of anything. A quarter second\u2019s lapse in concentration would kill him.\nBut though he told himself that, his gut tightened. Their timeline had just gotten shorter. And if he couldn\u2019t ascend\u2026\nThe Wandering Titan\u2019s tail cracked into him, and then he really did have to shove those concerns into the back of his mind.\nA short while later, Malice died.\n[That\u2019s a relief, isn\u2019t it? Plus one, minus one! Everything evens out!]\nThat was indeed something worth celebrating, but Lindon\u2019s concentration was at its limit. He kept his energy up by Consuming the attacks from his enemies, but they were constantly doing the same to him.\nOnly Reigan Shen couldn\u2019t use hunger madra to replace his power, but he used little enough anyway. He pounced when he could, striking just enough to keep Lindon off-balance.\nThat was how they continued as the day ran on. And into the night.\nIn the few, scattered seconds he had to think, Lindon wondered where Yerin had gone. He\u2019d expected her to join the fight, but hours continued to pass as the earth and sky quaked, and she never arrived.\n[I told her not to come here. We can still hang on.]\nLindon would have expected Yerin to show up anyway. She might not be able to fight the Dreadgods like he could, but she could at least keep Reigan Shen off his back.\nThe first newcomer to arrive in their delicate balance was Sha Miara. She appeared in a shimmer of rainbow light, and Dross began to sweat. At least, that was the image he showed Lindon.\n[If she joins in with Reigan Shen and they can coordinate with the Dreadgods, we\u2019ll last roughly another\u2026fourteen seconds.]\nLindon tensed even as he shattered a meteor dropped by the Wandering Titan, but Sha Miara didn\u2019t join the battle.", "761389e2-f559-46a4-83e9-3f0278fd60ef": "He\u2019d expected her to join the fight, but hours continued to pass as the earth and sky quaked, and she never arrived.\n[I told her not to come here.

In fact, Reigan Shen leaped through space to join her, shifting back into human form as he did.\nThe pressure lightened significantly. Though, in a way, the damage was done.\nLindon wasn\u2019t going to run out of madra, but there were other factors less easily quantified. He\u2019d kept stretching himself to fight at his maximum for almost a full day, and it wasn\u2019t as though he was fully rested and ready to go beforehand. He and Dross were both about to snap.\nBut he could hang on a little longer. That was what he\u2019d told himself a thousand times now.\nA little longer.\nHorizon-spanning sheets of rainbow madra grabbed the Bleeding Phoenix\u2019s barrage of Striker techniques before they could hit the coastline, redirecting them back into the ocean. That was the first time Lindon remembered being conscious of the fact that they had hit a coastline at all.\nSha Miara was working together with Reigan Shen to keep the fight from hitting Rosegold.\nThe Titan and the Phoenix didn\u2019t cooperate. An earthquake split the coast in half even as a blood-tinged hurricane scoured the skies. They were focused on Lindon, and didn\u2019t care what happened to the land.\nIt struck Lindon as funny that he and Reigan Shen were on the same side, though Shen probably didn\u2019t know it. Lindon would have gladly turned back to the ocean to avoid the populated continent, but now he was cornered. Stuck between the Dreadgods to the west and the pair of Monarchs to the east.\nIf he stayed where he was, he\u2019d be crushed. He needed to break through one side or the other, and the east was far easier.\nBut that would drag their battle onto the continent, so he tried to hold on. Nonetheless, with every technique, he was gradually pushed farther inland.\nUntil eight figures arrived in bright gold armor.\nLarian shouted something to him, probably a quip about being late to the party, but Lindon had his plate full. Through Dross, he told her what he needed.\nThey pulled Sha Miara back so Lindon could run. He borrowed the momentum from a punch of the Wandering Titan\u2019s, letting it blast him miles away so he could fly around and back to the ocean.\n[Uh-oh. They saw that one, huh?]\nA bloody wing of the Phoenix met Lindon as he tried to run.\nIt swept him back toward the land, and this time he really couldn\u2019t resist. By the time he caught himself in the air, he was over a city of the Rosegold continent.\nThe other two Dreadgods caught up to him in a moment, walking apocalypses of burning blood and rolling earth.\nThe fight raged on, crushing Reigan Shen\u2019s empire underfoot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nEmriss only had a connection to two Icons: the Oracle Icon, in the shape of an all-seeing eye, and the Life Icon.

In fairness, that could have worked, though there would be problems with consistency. It was risky, in other words, and not the best for long-term growth. But if one intended only to fight a few more times and then ascend, there were few downsides.\nEmriss, however, was better suited to a more subtle approach.\nShe traced the symbol of an eye in shining purple-and-green light over Ziel\u2019s head. \u201cSee yourself,\u201d she commanded.\nInsight could not be forced, but it could be taught.\nIn this case, if Ziel understood his Remnant more clearly, manifesting it would be easier. And it would be more likely to cooperate with him. This was the same advice she gave to anyone advancing to Herald, though it was more difficult for potential Monarchs.\nThen again, he was better-prepared than most, thanks to Lindon. It should roughly balance out.\nIt was only minutes later when his Remnant took shape.\nJudging by his expression when he opened his eyes, its form surprised him. Emriss was not shocked.\nZiel\u2019s Remnant was a hulking, horned creature with much longer horns than Ziel himself had. Its deep green body pulsed with violent energy, its thick jaw was locked in a perpetual expression of rage, and its hands were massive fists.\nEven so, it slumped onto the ground, staring at nothing.\nZiel pointed to it and looked to Emriss. \u201cHow am I supposed to get that thing to cooperate?\u201d\n\u201cThat thing is you,\u201d Emriss reminded him.\nThe Remnant let out a heavy breath.\nShe could see what he\u2019d been thinking. That wasn\u2019t only a result of time and wisdom; her connection to dreams had left her with the ability to see dream aura more clearly, and to interpret the subtle patterns every thinking being produced.\nThe skill wasn\u2019t as clear as reading thoughts like they were written on a page, but she could read general impressions. Coming face-to-face with his Remnant pained him. Its appearance told him something about himself, something he didn\u2019t like.\nEmriss left him as his Remnant flickered out, sliding back into his spirit. It would take him a few more attempts to manifest it steadily enough for a conversation.\nAnd to prepare for a fight. Fights were common during Herald manifestation, given that the sacred arts were primarily used as weapons.\nShe found Mercy easily enough, along with a very restless Yerin.\nAnd Little Blue, who wasn\u2019t supposed to be there.\n\u201cJust snapped into place for me, I don\u2019t know how many other words I need to say it.\u201d Yerin paced back and forth, rubbing her hands together.

The Dreadgods wouldn\u2019t hold back their attacks as they had for Reigan Shen, so just getting close to the battle would put Yerin\u2019s life in jeopardy. Lindon would have to fight while watching out for her.\nIf they were going to join the battle, it needed to be with a group that could actually take on at least one of the empowered Dreadgods.\nEmriss had made some preparations for that herself, but the more Monarchs they had, the better. Lindon could hold on a little while longer, and every minute he stayed in battle brought them that much closer to new allies.\nYerin ran a hand through her hair and looked about ready to say something, but instead she turned back to Mercy. \u201cYou\u2019ve been using a bow since you were half a foot tall, right? And you have the memories for it! Should be a springtime walk.\u201d\nMercy gave a shaky smile, but Emriss knew she was thinking differently.

She wasn\u2019t in the right state of mind to connect to the Icon she felt.\nOr so she thought.\n\u201cYerin, why don\u2019t you go help Ziel?\u201d Emriss suggested.

They had to contain his advancement to Herald, and Ziel was certain his Remnant wouldn\u2019t be cooperative.\nThe one glance he\u2019d taken was enough to convince him of that.\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope my Herald advancement will go as smoothly as Mercy\u2019s,\u201d he said to Yerin.\nShe eyed him as she pulled up a stone slab several times bigger than she was. \u201cYou\u2019d contend that your Remnant will be as soft as spring grass, would you?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cSame on my side.\u201d She settled the slab into place with an earth-shaking slam. \u201cNot an expert on this kind of advancement, but I\u2019d bet you\u2019re in for a fight.\u201d\nZiel didn\u2019t think so.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said with a sigh. \u201cMy Remnant will just sit there.\u201d\nYerin scratched a rune into the stone, following instructions Dross was giving her. \u201cYou\u2019d say so?\u201d\n\u201cYou saw it. I\u2019ll be wrestling dead weight.\u201d If anything, Ziel was worried that integrating his Remnant more closely into his body would slow him down. He had been lifeless for so long that the reality of his uselessness had settled into his soul.\nDross popped into visibility beside Ziel\u2019s head. [That\u2019s possible, sure! It\u2019s hard to say how someone\u2019s Remnant will act, and I don\u2019t have as many memories of advancing to Herald as I want. But\u2026]\nEmriss Silentborn\u2019s voice blew over to them like leaves on a gentle wind. \u201cYou should expect a fight.\u201d\nZiel scratched the side of his horns. \u201cAre you sure? It just sat there.\u201d\n\u201cReady to draw swords,\u201d Yerin said.\nWith the stone circle drawn wide\u2014much larger than Mercy\u2019s\u2014Ziel shrugged and sat down in the center. \u201cIf you say so.\u201d Privately, he still thought the others were underestimating him. Or overestimating his Remnant.\nThey hadn\u2019t known him during those years when he had wandered the Wasteland, with nothing and no one to guide him. They couldn\u2019t understand the scars time had left behind.\nZiel felt better than he had in years, but it would take much longer for his soul to get the message. Then again, if Emriss said so, he could be a little careful.\nHe pulled his hammer from his soulspace and set it to one side. Then he began to manifest his spirit once again.\n[Don\u2019t worry about your instability after advancing,] Dross said in a soothing tone. [There will definitely be some instability, so there\u2019s no point worrying about it. That\u2019s what Emriss is here for.]\nZiel knew the plan. Without stolen time and elixirs, he wouldn\u2019t be ready to advance to Monarch for decades at the earliest, so forcing the advancement would severely damage him. Fortunately, they had a plan for that.\nHe only had to do his part and take the first step into a new future. A new life. With that vision clear in his mind, Ziel manifested his Remnant.\nIt was exactly as he\u2019d feared.\nThe thing was a hulking jade creature, largely humanoid but with the head of a snarling monster. Its dull green horns were larger and sharper than Ziel\u2019s, and its four-fingered hands were slabs of muscle that opened and closed as though waiting for a skull to crush.\nAs with most Herald-level Remnants he\u2019d seen, his looked as real as a sacred beast. Though this one seemed like it had been the victim of cruel violence. It was covered in scars, a spiderweb of old wounds where the Remnant had been taken apart and stitched together long ago.\nThe spirit radiated the physical pressure of a force Remnant, but it slumped on the ground, staring into the distance. As though its heart died years ago.\nThen it caught sight of him.\nFire lit within the Remnant\u2019s eyes, and suddenly Ziel felt the weight of an oppressive and overwhelming rage.\nThe sight and feel of his own Remnant in fury shocked Ziel. Just for a moment, but the spirit seized on it.\nWith a roar, it leaped at him.\nZiel began to Forge rings with his Oathsign technique, but most of his spirit was outside his body. The Remnant tore apart his script with one hand, grabbed him by the head, and slammed him into the ground.\nEarth broke. Cracks spread out to the limit of the script-circle, where the runes shone silver and contained the impact.\nOr so Ziel glimpsed as he rose, coughing, through the cloud of dirt and dust. His body reeled, but his mind was even worse.\nHe felt everything the Remnant did.", "04f91375-b68b-4c80-8ca5-c494e088633c": "As though its heart died years ago.\nThen it caught sight of him.\nFire lit within the Remnant\u2019s eyes, and suddenly Ziel felt the weight of an oppressive and overwhelming rage.\nThe sight and feel of his own Remnant in fury shocked Ziel.

His body reeled, but his mind was even worse.\nHe felt everything the Remnant did. This was a spirit of wrath set free. It slammed itself against the invisible wall generated by the script-circle, and if the barrier had been any weaker, the Remnant would have torn its way through.\nOf course, a Monarch stood on the other side. Yerin\u2019s red lock of hair fluttered in the wind kicked up by the force-spirit, and she gave the Remnant an unimpressed look.\n\u201cYou like it better on that side,\u201d Yerin said flatly.\nZiel\u2019s Remnant roared, undeterred. If anything, it redoubled its efforts to break the boundary, attacking one of the stone slabs holding the script in place.\nHe could feel why. This was a creature of pure rage and pain. It hated everything, and wanted to destroy anything it could reach.\nItself, perhaps, most of all.\nUpon seeing the manifestation of his own spirit, Ziel\u2019s heart broke. This was the man he\u2019d been.\nDross made a considering sound. [You know, it\u2019s not as bad as I expected. I think we can take it.]\nWith his elixir-strengthened body, Ziel lifted his hammer one-handed while using no Enforcer technique. The spirit wasn\u2019t watching; it was clawing at the stone in an attempt to reach Yerin.\nUsing pure physical strength, Ziel slammed his hammer down on his Remnant.\nThe ground exploded again, but the Remnant leaped out of the cloud and clawed at Ziel. This time, Ziel held nothing back.\nHe traded hits with no defense. His bones broke, his blood sprayed, and even the hits he landed were doing nothing but damaging his own Remnant. His own spirit.\nNonetheless, he kept fighting.\nIt was a brutal, dirty fight. Ziel found that appropriate. He took the wounds as an acceptable cost while he and his Remnant tore each other to pieces.\nThis was his own pain. His own bitterness. He couldn\u2019t be rid of it, but he could face it, and he could move forward.\nHe didn\u2019t notice when it began, but gradually, the pieces torn off the Remnant began to fill in his own wounds.\nThe Shield Icon sang through him. Without it, he would have been destroyed in the first exchange. It kept him together as the Remnant fell apart further and further, the fight slowly fading in intensity as Ziel and his spirit became one.\nHe felt his body transform only once it was over. He stood in place, earth shattered around him. At some point, the script had been destroyed, and only Yerin\u2019s aura control kept the battle from spilling out further.\n[I couldn\u2019t control the change as well as you could, if you had been paying attention,] Dross said. [But I don\u2019t think you ended up too badly.]\nDross projected a reflection of Ziel like a mirror, so Ziel could see himself.\nHis horns were a little longer, but the biggest change showed in his skin. He was covered in scars where the Remnant\u2019s fingers had torn pieces out of him. And those scars had been filled with a dull jade.\nHe examined one slash on his chin. \u201cCould have been worse.\u201d\nYerin had been hovering over their battlefield, and she came to land next to him. She gave him an approving nod. \u201cLooks to me like we traded scars.\u201d\n\u201cYou had scars?\u201d Ziel asked.\n\u201cYou saw me with all the scars, I\u2019d bet my soul. Yeah, back on the island!\u201d\nHe shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t remember.\u201d\nShe looked oddly disappointed.\nZiel stretched his madra, feeling it twist through his flesh more efficiently than ever before, and exulted in the power of a Monarch. The aura for miles stilled, bowing to its new ruler.\nThen he steadily fell onto his face.\nCan you get Emriss, please? Ziel asked Dross.\n[Hm.", "3c2d71bc-fa87-4340-8303-487adf523fc1": "He was covered in scars where the Remnant\u2019s fingers had torn pieces out of him.

I\u2019ll try again in a few minutes.]\nZiel lay face-down in the dirt.\nNo rush.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nMercy sat on a stump in the shade of an ancient tree. But not so ancient as the one that stood across from her in human form, leaning on a diamond-tipped staff and smiling gently.\n\u201cHeralds hear their own spirits more loudly,\u201d Emriss Silentborn said. \u201cThis makes it more difficult for them to hear deeper, subtler powers, though the Icons remain.\u201d\nMercy drew in her breath and felt the still-unfamiliar power of a Herald flowing through her. She felt as though she had only managed to stand on wobbly legs, but she was now being asked to run. \u201cAm I ready?\u201d she asked.\n\u201cNo,\u201d the Monarch said. \u201cBut we must often do things we are not ready for. You\u2019ve learned this lesson again only recently, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\nMercy\u2019s heart and spirit trembled. She nodded, not trusting herself to speak.\nEmriss\u2019 wrinkled face softened, and Mercy knew the old Monarch understood her. \u201cYou took in much of your mother\u2019s will.

It reflected power, rulership, dominance, and conquering for the sake of order.\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026want them.\u201d That fell flat to Mercy\u2019s own ears, and she wanted to explain further, but Emriss nodded as though she understood completely.\n\u201cThose were your mother\u2019s Path. The Crown Icon, the Shadow Icon, the Strength Icon\u2026they represented the ideals she strove for, the concepts that had defined her since she was a girl.\u201d\nEmriss leaned her staff against a nearby tree and took a seat on a rock. \u201cOzmanthus advised the young Void Sage to consider how others saw him. To use their perception of him as a looking-glass to glimpse how he was reflected in reality. He was instructed to look for a concept that defined him, even in his childhood. So tell me, Mercy, how do people see you?\u201d\nMercy considered. She knew how she thought other people saw her, but Lindon had an advantage in that area. He could steal people\u2019s memories.\n[I can show her,] Dross offered, and Mercy noticed that he was looking to Emriss for permission rather than Mercy herself.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t I help?\u201d Emriss suggested. She waved a hand, and she cast out a working of dream aura so subtle and complex that it felt like a warm breeze but sank through Mercy\u2019s thoughts in an instant.\nThe Ruler technique brought out specific memories and shed a spotlight onto them. With a jolt of fresh pain, Mercy realized they were her mother\u2019s memories.\nTo name her direct descendants, Malice looked into the future and highlighted what she saw as their greatest feature. Not all Akura clan members got this treatment, Mercy knew; at some point, naming family members after virtues had become tradition rather than actual prophecy.\nBut now, with Dross and Emriss to sort the memories she\u2019d absorbed from her mother, she saw Malice in her visions.\nSurrounded by dark statues, Malice sought her son. She saw him as a sculpture of shadow, laughing as he struck dragons from the sky.\nHe exulted in battle, and his anger became a sword to destroy the family\u2019s enemies.

Malice looked closer and saw the girl spreading messages and monitoring the well-being of the people, uniting them to stand against the powers of the wilderness.

She began to wonder if Malice had really left all these memories behind or if Emriss was adding a few stolen from somewhere else.\nFinally, she came to her own vision.\nMercy was only a baby, still wailing, when Malice looked into her future. She saw her youngest daughter with a broad smile clear even on the dark statues in the World of Night. She healed, she laughed, and she cried for the sake of others.\nAnd, in the end, Malice saw her daughter as another light rising over the dark mountains of the Akura clan.\nMalice leaned back, satisfied, and let her World of Night fade. She looked down to the baby in her arms and named her.\nShe would be a light to complement the shadows. The Mercy to counterbalance the family\u2019s Malice.\nWhere the Monarch failed, her daughter would bring joy.\nMercy came out of the vision, and it was only with a great exercise of will that she stopped herself from crying.\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel any of that right now,\u201d she said.\nEmriss gave a small smile. \u201cA common misunderstanding. You can bring joy to others even when you don\u2019t feel it yourself.\u201d\nQuietly, Dross fed Mercy the memories taken from Lindon and Yerin. Memories of her.\nIn their eyes, Mercy brought joy.\nMercy curled up, hugging her knees to her chin, cheeks burning. She squeezed her eyes shut as she tried to sort through her feelings.\nShe didn\u2019t need to see the flower blooming in the sky overhead to know it was bright violet.\nThe Joy Icon.\nHer spirit magnified, deepening, her madra feeling more connected to the world than ever before. Her spiritual perception strengthened until she felt she could stretch it out endlessly, and the aura around her felt so close that she thought she could speak a single word and all reality would bend to her will.\nAbruptly, she realized that she was feeling the remainder of a great battle fought nearby, and another powerful spirit trying to wrestle itself under control. She extended her perception and felt Ziel lying nearby.\nHe felt like a cold star, a bottomless well of power covered over. Like he was dead.\nMercy looked to Emriss in shock, but the Monarch\u2014the other Monarch\u2014shook her head. \u201cHe\u2019s alive, but this is a natural outcome of pushing as hard as you have. You have both broken natural rules by pushing to Monarch so quickly, and that has consequences.\u201d\nEmriss pulled out a glistening rainbow gem the size of her head. \u201cTherefore, we will have to break a few more rules.

Her powers were weaker here and theirs stronger.\nHer Mantle burned low, a flame that needed a fresh log. She would need to renew it when she escaped.\nBut worse than her situation was the time she\u2019d lost. She could feel the battle in Vesper, and it haunted her imagination.\nEspecially when she felt Ozriel vanish.\nMoments later, she struggled free of the Fiends and tore her way back into the world. The situation was clear at a glance.\nHalf of the Mad King\u2019s body was missing. His flesh twisted and bubbled as he faded away, having been half-erased by the Scythe of Ozriel. Soon, he would be dead.\nBut his red-eyed face wore an expression of satisfaction.\nOzriel was gone. More than gone. The Sword of Makiel drifted in vacuum, and neither dust nor echo remained of the Reaper.\nThe Mad King looked at her. \u201cThis is what healing requires,\u201d he said, sounding entirely calm. And very human.\nEvery second that passed was a missed opportunity. \u201cOzriel already sentenced you to die.\u201d She lifted her Razor, each branch of its blade gleaming with points of light.\n\u201cThen as a doomed man, I request clemency for my people.\u201d\nSuriel didn\u2019t answer him.\nShe excised him.\nA thousand points of needle-sharp light pierced him from every angle, cutting him from existence.\nAnd only him.\nThere was no Fiend\u2019s shadow behind him. Oth\u2019kimeth must have escaped while she was in the Void, which was itself worth investigating. If the Fiend had escaped into the Void, she should have seen it.\nNonetheless, Oth\u2019kimeth\u2019s absence sealed the fate of its host.\nThough Suriel had not been around for the beginning of his story, she wrote the end of King Daruman\u2019s legend with her own hands.\nThe Scythe of Ozriel and the Sword of Makiel both vanished at gestures from the Hound. He met Suriel with a face of stone. \u201cCan you save him?\u201d\nNot if she kept talking. It would be hard enough to restore someone killed by the Mad King\u2019s direct effort, even if she were at her full strength. And the more time ran, the harder it would be.\nWithout answering, Suriel reached out to the Way. She pushed her Mantle to its limit, squeezing every drop of authority she could from her long history as the greatest healer in existence.\n\u201cReturn,\u201d Suriel commanded.\nThis was an order of magnitude more difficult than reversing the time of an entire Iteration.\nIf the Mad King had been using the Reaper\u2019s Scythe, her job would have been impossible. His sword might not have that level of authority, but it was still a weapon capable of combat with Judges.

Something disappeared; she thought it was his Mantle.\nThen another will joined hers.\nHer efforts surged again. Makiel was never a candidate for her position, but he had still earned several stars for his restoration skills. Unlike Ozriel, he had plenty of talent as a Phoenix.\n[Makiel is in contact with Tal\u2019gullour,] her Presence informed her.\nIf she hadn\u2019t been so totally concentrated, that possibility would have chilled her. What was Makiel doing, communicating with a Vroshir home-world? Together, he and the remaining crew of the fortress could shut down her working. They could ensure that the Reaper remained lost.\nSure enough, she felt a working begin to warp the space around her. She started to struggle until she caught the target.\nTal\u2019gullour was targeting Makiel.\n\u201cWhat are you doing, Makiel?\u201d Suriel asked through gritted teeth.\n\u201cI am no longer Makiel,\u201d he said. His voice was no different than normal. \u201cI retired my position. And I\u2019m helping you. I\u2019m not as skilled of a Phoenix as you are, so I\u2019m borrowing the systems of Tal\u2019gullour.\u201d\nShe read the working and saw that it was true. This was some kind of transference ritual.\nTransferring his life.\n\u201cMakiel, stop,\u201d she ordered.\n\u201cMy name was Tommess,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I intended to give up my position on our return anyway. Consider this my revenge.\u201d\nWhen she realized what he meant, she gave one dry laugh.\n\u201cHe will hate this,\u201d Suriel agreed.\nBy the way Ozriel reckoned things, he would consider it a loss to be resurrected at the cost of Makiel\u2019s life. A loss he would never be able to wipe off.\nThough the outward signs were few, Suriel felt the life fading from inside Makiel. He became less with every passing second.\nAnd her blue, healing fire grew stronger and stronger.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to work,\u201d she assured him.\nThe wrinkles by Makiel\u2019s eyes deepened as he smiled. \u201cI know. I know\u2026everything.\u201d\nIt was perhaps the most like Ozriel the man had ever sounded.\nThe second the light in his eyes faded, Ozriel reappeared in a column of sapphire flames.\nHe looked down at his hands and patted his own chest in disbelief. \u201cYou really did it! I said I was counting on you, but I didn\u2019t actually believe you could do it.\u201d\n\u201cMakiel\u2014\u201d Suriel began, but Ozriel waved away the rest of her sentence.\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said.

He gazed at the body floating in space, and Suriel saw the weight of ages and the sadness of the Reaper reflected in him again.\n\u201cI know everything,\u201d Ozriel said softly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\nLindon Consumed a spear from the Bleeding Phoenix before it crashed through the center of a city. Undirected blood madra still sprayed all over the buildings, but that much they could handle.\nAs Lindon cycled the power to refresh his body and spirit, he consulted with Dross.\nCan we hold on?\n[I\u2019ve told them how long we have! At this rate, we\u2019ll be lucky to last another minute.]\nLindon had trouble recognizing his own emotions. On the one hand, this was the first time he felt hope in this battle against the Dreadgods. On the other, all his bridges away had been cut.\nIf they won here, the world was changed.\nIf they lost\u2026in the best-case scenario, he would be stuck behind alone. In the worst-case, he would finish his transformation into a monster and destroy Cradle himself.\nThe Wandering Titan hurled a golden bolt of Forged madra the size of a small mountain. Lindon would dodge, except the Phoenix had carved out a globe of madra that isolated him from the rest of the world. The spatial barrier would break when the Titan\u2019s attack crashed into it, but then it would be too late to avoid it.\nHe had no choice but to block.\nLindon filled the globe with the Hollow Domain and himself with the Soul Cloak. When the Titan\u2019s Forger technique crashed through the spatial barrier, Lindon punched it.\nThough the attack was vastly larger than his body, his strike cracked it into pieces from top to bottom. The fabric of space trembled and quaked from the collision of forces.\n[Now would be the time to do a countdown,] Dross said, [but I don\u2019t want to depress you.]\nThe Dreadgods had locked Lindon in place for long enough. Now, they were closing in.\nHis Empty Palm tore away a chunk of the Titan\u2019s Enforcer technique, but he deflected a beam of light from the Phoenix just a beat too late. That put him a moment behind when trading blows with the Wandering Titan, so he was even further behind.\nLindon didn\u2019t need Dross to show him the potential outcomes narrowing. He could feel the inevitable end of the fight closing in with every imperfect block sending shockwaves through his body, every forced dodge that strained his spirit.\nHe still wouldn\u2019t give up. He pushed for every ounce of speed, and for any ideas that might turn the situation around.\nBut he found that he wasn\u2019t as frightened as he\u2019d expected. If he died here, he still would have made it further than anyone had expected.\nAnd, in a way, this was appropriate. He had always been destined to die at the hands of the Dreadgods.\n[Now!] Dross shouted, but he wasn\u2019t talking to Lindon. A white light flashed in front of Lindon\u2019s face, and for a moment, the world lost all color.\nYerin\u2019s six spread sword-arms rang like an entire cathedral full of bells.\nThe Endless Sword technique tore into the other two Dreadgods. Powered by a Monarch and with the influence of the Death Icon, the technique chipped pieces out of the Wandering Titan and splattered tiny chunks of the Bleeding Phoenix.\nTo the Dreadgods, that was the equivalent of a scratch from a branch. Lindon himself could have walked through the technique and sustained only minor injuries, much less the Wandering Titan.\nBut it had come at the right time.\nThe pressure lifted, and Lindon saw a way out. He flew through a gap between the Dreadgods, Yerin pushing to keep pace with him.\n\u201cGratitude,\u201d Lindon said between heavy breaths.\n\u201cBleed and bury me, that was too close!\u201d Yerin shouted. \u201cYou cut it too close, Dross! You hearing me? If I listen to you again, it\u2019s because I\u2019m cracked in the head! One more second, and he\u2019d be Dreadgod food!\u201d\n[Oh, less than that. But you made it! You did make it, so no harm done. In fact, I think I deserve praise.]\nLindon\u2019s Empty Palm blasted apart a parting shot from the Phoenix. \u201cWhere are the others?\u201d\nHe was asking Yerin, but Dross responded. [They\u2019re not quite so fast as Yerin, but you\u2019ll find out yourself in three\u2026two\u2026]\nFive powerful spirits stepped out of a portal nearby, and Lindon felt them arrive.", "25f17f4c-512a-4ec2-9037-e1aebb21a690": "\u201cGratitude,\u201d Lindon said between heavy breaths.\n\u201cBleed and bury me, that was too close!\u201d Yerin shouted. \u201cYou cut it too close, Dross!

Two of them unveiled themselves, tapping into their Icons as a form of introduction.\nA detailed, steel-plated shield shared space in the sky with a shining, blooming flower.\nEven the Dreadgods slowed down, though they didn\u2019t retreat. Lindon weighed the spiritual pressure of both sides.\nSha Miara, Reigan Shen, and two Dreadgods.\nEmriss Silentborn, the Eight-Man Empire, Mercy, Ziel, and Yerin.\nMentally, Lindon split the enemies in half. \u201cWhich Dreadgod would you like?\u201d he asked.\nYerin snorted. \u201cGive you two guesses, and the first doesn\u2019t count.\u201d\nLindon spoke again, and Dross relayed his words to the others on the battlefield. \u201cEveryone, I would be grateful if you could contain the Bleeding Phoenix and keep the enemy Monarchs away from me. I will face the Wandering Titan.\u201d\nZiel\u2019s muttered voice sounded like it was coming from next to Lindon\u2019s ear. \u201cAdvance to Archlord, he\u2019s a Sage. Advance to Sage, he\u2019s a Dreadgod. Advance to Monarch, he\u2019s off to kill a Dreadgod on his own.\u201d\nA moment passed, and then Ziel\u2019s voice came again. \u201cDross? You didn\u2019t send that to him, did you?\u201d\nYerin started to fly off, but hesitated and turned back to him. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to advance, swear on my soul. Got a little lost. Then Dross told us the trouble you were in\u2026You\u2019ll catch up to us in half a second, okay?\u201d\nLindon forced a smile. \u201cAll that matters is that you\u2019re alive.\u201d\nHe was trying not to think about what was going to happen after the battle. Especially since they still had Dreadgods left to kill.\nThe Phoenix and the Titan weren\u2019t leaving them alone out of the goodness of their hearts, either. They had backed away warily from the lineup of enemy Monarchs, standing closer to Reigan Shen and Sha Miara, and begun spreading their authority over the land.\nDirt raised into the air and stone quaked under the Titan\u2019s influence.\nAt the same time, the Phoenix\u2019s power stained the air. Blood began to coalesce and transform into humanoid puppet-figures.\nTime was not on their side.\nYerin struggled visibly with her words, but finally flew off to join the others. Emriss had already begun a working centered on the Phoenix.\nWhich left Lindon hovering in midair and staring into the Wandering Titan\u2019s eyes across a gulf of broken city.\nThe Wandering Titan glared back as though it had heard their plan. Perhaps it had.\nLindon remembered the deep, rumbling voice he\u2019d heard when he\u2019d first Consumed the Dreadgod\u2019s memories. It stood opposite him now, lashing its tail lazily behind it. Its dark shell shone bright yellow from within, and stone flew up from the bones of the earth.\nGuided by aura, chunks of metal and stone molded themselves into an impossibly huge sword.\nNow, the Wandering Titan matched the legends Abyssal Palace told about its combat prowess. It looked the same as it did on the murals in the labyrinth.\nWhere it had been born. And where, in Suriel\u2019s vision so long ago, Lindon had seen it wading through mountains to destroy his home.\nIn a way, it had succeeded.\nLindon rolled Suriel\u2019s marble in his left hand, watching those memories. And remembering the Unsouled destined to be one of thousands crushed beneath the Dreadgod\u2019s feet.\nNow, a white halo hovered over Lindon\u2019s head, and nine flying swords spread out behind him.

It\u2019s that or ascend.\u201d\nEven covered by her rainbow-light disguise, Sha Miara\u2019s motions were desperate. \u201cWe can reason with Emriss! She\u2019ll listen!\u201d\nReigan suspected that any reasoning between Emriss Silentborn and Sha Miara was going to result in one rainbow-colored young woman drifting up to the heavens. He had to prevent contact between them, or he would be the only one left on his side. Which was not a winning scenario.\nHe clenched the Wraith Horn in one hand. He couldn\u2019t risk losing that anymore; it was his one lifeline. \u201cEmriss hid herself closely, even from us. She\u2019s been lying to you all your life.\u201d\n\u201cMy mother\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShe lied to your mother too! And her mother! She was acting, do you understand?\u201d\nReigan wrenched Yerin\u2019s Moonlight Bridge to one side before she could use it in an ambush. Instead of appearing behind the Phoenix, she was sent miles away.\nHe wished he could control the Bridge precisely enough to send Yerin straight into the Phoenix\u2019s beak\u2014or, poetically, into the path of one of Lindon\u2019s techniques\u2014but the best he could do was to shove her aside.\nRainbow light blocked a spinning circle of Dawn Oath runes, causing the entire script to fall apart. \u201cI understand, but what do we do?\u201d Miara hesitated before adding, \u201cIs ascending really so bad?\u201d\nOut of sheer frustration, Reigan wanted to claw the human girl\u2019s head off.\nHe couldn\u2019t, of course. He might win a battle against her, but it would be a drawn-out affair, and it certainly wasn\u2019t something he could afford now. Emriss\u2019 branches would be around his throat the second he turned his back.\n\u201cThis is the world we worked for!\u201d Reigan insisted. \u201cWe don\u2019t owe it to anyone.\u201d\nThen again, the world Reigan had worked for was being torn apart beneath him.\nEvery step the Dreadgods took deeper into his continent destroyed his own resources. Buildings, forests, mines, natural treasures, workers, herds of prey. They were breaking his own empire by the second.\nAnd, worse, they were losing.\nThe Eight-Man Empire assaulted the Bleeding Phoenix with a barrage of techniques almost as broad as the Dreadgod\u2019s own. Striker techniques from the Phoenix crashed into barriers created by Ziel of the Dawnwing Sect and reinforced by the Shield Icon. Malice\u2019s daughter had grown her armor to Dreadgod size and was trading physical blows with the Phoenix itself.\nBlue-green leaves of Forged madra spread everywhere, each etched with an eye. Emriss watched from every one of them, spreading a perfect view of the battlefield. She couldn\u2019t directly reverse injuries caused by the Dreadgods, but she wove life aura with expert precision, accelerating natural healing.\nBits of the Bleeding Phoenix sprayed off into the air. It was hard to see, given the composition of the semi-liquid Dreadgod, but Reigan could tell. Gradually, the Phoenix was getting smaller.\nThe enemies were winning. Given time, they would grind the Dreadgod down.\nThe Wandering Titan could break that stalemate. It was how the Dreadgods had operated in the past; threaten one, and the others would pounce on you and tear you to pieces.\nBut, in the worst news yet, the Titan\u2019s clash against the Ghost was evenly matched. If the Wandering Titan had been losing, Reigan had thought he might be able to goad it into using its last moments to kill some Monarchs.\nAt this rate, Lindon\u2019s battle wouldn\u2019t conclude until after the Phoenix was already dead. And therefore Reigan too.\nBitterly, Reigan stopped projecting portals. While it burned his pride, he had to admit it: he\u2019d lost. After all this time, he would have to give up. Now was the time to cut losses and run.\nMiara\u2019s royal madra covered the sky, stronger than ever, even seizing and redirecting one of Yerin\u2019s deadly black-and-white Striker techniques. She was still hanging on. He had to give her credit for that.\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough,\u201d Reigan said.

He called up King\u2019s Key madra in a line in front of him, a razor-edged blade as thin as the side of a portal.\nYerin\u2019s attack, strengthened by Sha Miara, split in a wave around him.\nBut he wasn\u2019t unscathed.\nThe lethal authority in the attack shaved away at his lifeline and split open his skin. Blood splattered behind him.\nHe didn\u2019t feel the pain. Only shock.\nSha Miara gazed at him, pitiless behind her rainbow mask. Without a word, she slashed him with a blade of royal madra.\nHe tried to raise his hand to block, only to find that his left arm was missing. Her technique passed through him, though it scarcely touched his body. His spirit, however, was split in half.\nEmriss Silentborn seemed to stride out of nowhere on a half-ruined hillside nearby. \u201cWell done, Miara. I know that was difficult, but he couldn\u2019t be trusted.\u201d\nHe was the one who couldn\u2019t be trusted?\nFury and hatred boiled up from his heart. This whole scenario had been engineered by Emriss from the start! Who had allowed Lindon to Consume the Silent King? Who had prevented the Monarchs from killing him? Who had pretended to be on their side for centuries while plotting against them?\nReigan opened his mouth to denounce her, but he vomited a mouthful of white-gold sparks instead. From inside his body, his madra was fading to essence. Miara\u2019s blade had passed through his core.\n\u201cOh look,\u201d Emriss said idly. \u201cA split core.\u201d\nThis time, Reigan Shen spit up blood.\nSha Miara strode over to Reigan, still carrying her Forged blade. \u201cI knew he was going to give me up. He betrayed Tiberian too. I was just using him until the time came.\u201d\nReigan shouted at her in his head. She hadn\u2019t seen a thing. Five seconds ago, she was a panicked mess. Sha Miara was just trying to jump ship, and she was doing it with the subtlety of a drunken ape.\nEmriss gave an understanding smile. \u201cI always knew, dear.\u201d She really did lie with every breath. Reigan didn\u2019t know how he hadn\u2019t seen it before. \u201cNow, take that weapon away from him. We don\u2019t want him pulling any last-second tricks.\u201d\nReigan did have one last-second trick left. It might not save him, but he hardly had a choice.\nHe acted as though he was on the verge of dying, which was no stretch.\nSha Miara lifted her sword again. \u201cI know what to do,\u201d she said. Then she made a mistake anyway. She brought the blade of madra down on him.\nReigan brought up the Wraith Horn. With the little madra he could still control, he forced the construct to activate.\nDreadgod bindings always had several functions.

He had elixirs that could mend his spirit, he was sure. He just had to hold himself together.\n\u201cBe healed,\u201d he commanded himself, though his voice was weaker than he liked.\nHis madra system sluggishly pulled itself together, but it quickly stopped. He was not the best at restoration, and wounds left by a Monarch were not so easily removed.\nThe room\u2019s only other occupant strolled up to observe him. Feet of blue storm madra crackled in front of Reigan\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cI see you had too big a dose,\u201d Tiberian\u2019s Remnant said gravely. \u201cYou see, it\u2019s always best to take small sips when you\u2019re drinking your own medicine.\u201d\n\u201cHeal\u2026me!\u201d\nTiberian spread glowing hands. \u201cEven if I had the same connection to Icons I did when I was alive, storms and spears are not known for their healing powers.\u201d\nReigan\u2019s heart was fluttering. He burned soulfire to transform back into his original form to recover some vitality, but even in lion form, there was no strength in his limbs. He toppled onto his side, madra still leaking from his mouth.\n\u201cYou ever wonder how it came to this?\u201d the Remnant asked. He sat down on a scripted bench and looked up at the ceiling. \u201cWe sat idly by for so long that the very heavens descended to clean up our mess.\u201d\nReigan Shen tried to snarl defiance, but he managed only a weak, glowing cough. He hadn\u2019t been idle, he had been building a home. The heavens had only descended to knock it over, like a child kicking an anthill.\nNonetheless, he had no option left but to try again. He could always come back; Ozmanthus had proven that.\nHe reached out, beyond the world, and tried to touch the Way.\nI ascend! he shouted in his mind. But he was losing connection to his powers. His will was fading by the second.\nTiberian stroked a beard that was now hewn from lightning. \u201cI admit, this would not have been my first choice. But I suppose we\u2019re going to get to know each other better from here on out, Shen. Maybe you\u2019ll make a better spirit than you did a man.\u201d\nLion, Reigan tried to insist. I was always a lion.\nBut when his Remnant rose from his body, it was in the shape of a man.\nA man holding a goblet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n[That was Reigan Shen,] Dross reported.\nLindon launched dragon\u2019s breath that the Wandering Titan caught on its shell. With Shen gone, the battle against the Bleeding Phoenix had finally tilted their way.\nA fist clenched around his heart. Now, the only thing left was to finish the Dreadgods.\nBut if they did, the Monarchs would have to ascend.\nHow long will I have to say good-bye, Dross?\nDross predicted the passage of the Titan\u2019s sword and showed the probable angle of its tail before answering. [If they both die at about the same time\u2026huh. There might be a failure of language here.

Lindon could make it a year.\n[Or longer,] Dross reminded him.\nLindon drew Wavedancer back and harassed the Titan with Blackflame. Dross kept up the mental assault.\nThe fight wasn\u2019t quite over yet. Lindon still had time to think of something else.\n[\u2026I almost don\u2019t want to bring it up now, but without Reigan Shen\u2026I do have a solution.]\nLindon wished Dross hadn\u2019t said anything. He wasn\u2019t ready. This had all gone so fast. And not just the battle; suddenly, everything since leaving Sacred Valley for the first time felt like it had passed by in a rush.\nHis eyes found Yerin, who had been with him since he was an Unsouled. She zipped around the Bleeding Phoenix, her cuts carrying echoes of death itself.\nLindon caught a stray Phoenix technique with an Empty Palm big enough to crush a village. The wave of acidic blood madra was wiped away, but stray drops landed on him. The flesh he lost was replaced in an instant by his Bloodforged Iron body.\nIt felt like only moments ago he had been in a cave, begging for more drops of sandviper venom.\nLindon lashed out with a bar of Blackflame, now a stream of blazing darkness. It carved a trench into the rocky skin of the Wandering Titan.\nThe Titan roared louder and struck back, its sword a flickering haze. That sword came to a stop when it struck a wall of solid amethyst.\nMercy, the size of a tower, gave the Titan her full attention. She leveled a black-and-white striped bow sized to fit her, Forging a dark arrow onto its string. Over her head bloomed a white halo and a violet flower.\nLindon remembered her as a Lowgold in the Skysworn, unable to watch her mother do battle with a Dreadgod. Now, her arrows darkened the sky as the Wandering Titan weathered her assault.\nThe Phoenix lit the coastline red as it faced a silver-and-green blur. Ziel, the man Lindon had known as a Truegold in the heart of Ghostwater, was now a shield holding back the Bleeding Phoenix.\nThe Titan pushed for Mercy, wading through a stream of dragon\u2019s breath.\nOrthos, in his human form, shouted as he poured all the power he could into the Dreadgod. Above him, the Icon of a black dragon slithered through the sky.\nThe Wandering Titan\u2019s sword lifted, trailing golden madra. Lindon had thought he\u2019d lost Orthos before, in Night Wheel Valley. He wouldn\u2019t let it happen again.\nWavedancer, Lindon\u2019s prize from the Uncrowned King tournament, gathered crackling blue-and-gold power.

When he\u2019d faced this attack in Sacred Valley, it had been a deadly blow.\nNow, Little Blue erupted into a Hollow Domain that wiped out the excess energy the tail carried. With a Soul Cloak powered by Lindon\u2019s madra, she met the strike with a punch of her own.\nShe stopped the blow, and it was Dross\u2019 turn.\nHe tapped into the Crown of the Silent King, magnifying his mental assault, and struck at the Titan\u2019s mind.\nHe used the same technique that had exhausted him before. It had almost cost him his life, just to make a weakened Titan retreat.\nThis time, the Wandering Titan staggered in place, its mind temporarily overwhelmed.\nAnd the timing passed to Lindon.\nBlack fire condensed into claws onto Lindon\u2019s left hand, dragging a smoky tail of destruction aura that reached into the sky. He slammed into the Titan\u2019s head, bringing down The Dragon Descends.\nThe technique detonated. For a moment, it blacked out the world, filled with such Void authority that the sky darkened.\nAs it had when the Reaper ascended.\nSight returned, and Lindon fled the retaliation of the Titan. Its head was split, bleeding golden light, and it lashed out wildly with a technique of ancient stone.\nHe Consumed the earth madra with the right hand of the Slumbering Wraith. Through his body, veins of white spread, infecting him. His time grew ever shorter. If the Monarchs remained any longer, he would lose himself.\nThat was the price he\u2019d chosen.\nThe Titan backed off one step and refreshed its Enforcer technique. More gold light covered it in flowing armor.\nJust the pressure from that step and the internal technique sent force rocketing through the streets of what had once been a city. Half-ruined buildings completely collapsed, and foundations were ruptured.\nThe Dreadgods destroyed the world just by existing. Letting them stay another second was too long.\nWhat was a year or two? Lindon fully intended to live forever.\nTogether, with his friends, on the other side of the Way.\nApologies, Dross. Let\u2019s go.\nMessages passed in an instant between the different versions of Dross, and everyone moved together.\nYerin broke off from the Phoenix suddenly, her sword-arms drawn back. Power concentrated in each one as she formed her master\u2019s technique: the Final Sword. But this time, the Death Icon resonated with the technique.\nThe Bleeding Phoenix spun in the air to watch her, but Yerin switched her attention. Over to the Titan.\nFrom her Goldsigns, she unleashed a six-sided blade of energy that shone silver and red but carried absolutely lethal intent.\nThe Wandering Titan held up its sword to block.\nZiel Forged a circle over the Titan\u2019s head, focusing vital aura for hundreds of miles. The Titan was bound within, restricted by every aspect of aura.\nA black star fell from the sky: Mercy\u2019s arrow. It bore with it every one of her techniques, and as it fell, dozens of copies split off to land together.\nIf they were the only ones fighting the Titan, this wouldn\u2019t be a threat to its life. This was worth the Dreadgod equivalent of a bloody nose and a black eye.\nBut their jabs kept the Titan in place.\nAll the while, Wavedancer had continued holding crackling blue-and-gold power. It shone like a sun of storm madra, and now that the Wandering Titan was locked down, Lindon released it.\nBurning liquid light lanced out from the sword, many times thicker than Lindon\u2019s body. The Weeping Dragon\u2019s breath was blinding to the eye and spirit both, until it was hard to sense even the Dreadgods below. The Titan focused, turning its shell and raising its madra, defending against a truly lethal hit.\nAnd, thanks to a temporary veil provided by Dross with the Silent King\u2019s Crown, it didn\u2019t see Lindon dashing up from below.\nNot until it was too late.", "c9932642-fa7d-47b6-a13b-dbbdff403015": "This was worth the Dreadgod equivalent of a bloody nose and a black eye.\nBut their jabs kept the Titan in place.\nAll the while, Wavedancer had continued holding crackling blue-and-gold power.

A Dreadgod\u2019s spirit, being improperly fused to its flesh, wasn\u2019t easily disrupted. But this was the technique Lindon had perfected the most. It was a part of him.\nThe Void Icon wiped out the Titan\u2019s power. Only for a moment.\nThen the Weeping Dragon\u2019s breath, the technique that had cut a scar into the face of the moon, speared the Dreadgod through the center.\nDross showed Lindon what was about to happen. The Wandering Titan would slowly lock up from the legs first, like a puppet-construct losing power and forgetting how to walk. It would, at last, lose the golden light in its eyes and become a statue. Dross assumed it wouldn\u2019t collapse under its own weight, but that remained to be seen.\nLindon couldn\u2019t watch it happen with his own eyes, because it would only take a few seconds.\nAnd in those seconds, he had another Dreadgod to kill. If the Wandering Titan really died, his own transformation would progress while the Phoenix grew too powerful. In the nightmare scenario, the others would have to face down both the Bleeding Phoenix and the Empty Ghost together.\nLindon blasted through the air toward the Phoenix.\nYerin was dodging a spear of crimson light as he flew past her. The Phoenix re-focused on him.\nLindon didn\u2019t bother with Blackflame. The Bleeding Phoenix\u2019s body didn\u2019t have the same composition as the other Dreadgods. There was little separation between its actual flesh and the living madra that made it up.\nHe activated the Hollow Domain.\nThe blue-white light covered one of the Phoenix\u2019s wings. The wing didn\u2019t immediately fall apart, but it didn\u2019t resist when Lindon crashed into it. And dove right through it. It felt like diving into an ocean of warm pudding, but it smelled like a slaughterhouse.\nLindon\u2019s arm couldn\u2019t be contained anymore.\nHis Consume technique slipped its restraints and began devouring everything it could reach.\nFrom the inside, the Phoenix\u2019s scream was like a physical blow. Every aspect of madra and aura that could be combined with blood assaulted his body, tearing him apart, but he rebuilt himself with what he Consumed.\n[You\u2026see what\u2019s happening, don\u2019t you?] Dross asked.\nThe hunger arm was powering his Bloodforged Iron body. The two had formed a strange synergy. Every wound that Lindon suffered was now being filled with inhuman white flesh, like a pasty sludge.\n[I thought you did.] Dross took a deep breath, or at least made the sound of one. [All right, let\u2019s put it all on the table! That\u2019s what they say, right? The table?]\nThe Silent King\u2019s Crown expanded over Lindon\u2019s head again, and a psychic explosion rocked the Phoenix. Emriss joined in, her techniques like gentle leaves.\nThe Bleeding Phoenix retaliated on the outside, but rainbow madra filled it, warping its techniques, pushing back against its spirit. The royal madra of Sha Miara.\nFrom the outside, Ziel\u2019s techniques fell like hundreds of hammers, shaking the Dreadgod. Mercy\u2019s arrows stabbed into the mind and the spirit, carrying heavy shadows.

He and Dross were giving it everything they had, and\u2014with their support from the outside\u2014they would kill the Phoenix in another minute or two. But that was a minute or two they didn\u2019t have.\nSilver light intruded on the red, and Yerin stumbled into the wound Lindon had managed to carve into the Phoenix.\nYerin shuddered. \u201cTell you true, this is the last place I ever wanted to be.\u201d\nShe drew back all her sword-arms, and the overwhelming red color faded.\nLindon opened his mouth to speak, but he looked down at himself. The Slumbering Wraith\u2019s flesh grew out of him everywhere.\nHe couldn\u2019t think of anything to say that summed up everything he felt, so he tucked it all into one word.\n\u201cApologies,\u201d Lindon said.\nYerin had tears in her eyes, but her smile was brilliant. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Eithan to save you a seat.\u201d Then she turned back to the Dreadgod who had ruined half her life. \u201cNow let\u2019s get this bird to die.\u201d\nThe Void Icon resonated the same tone as the Death Icon, and Lindon joined his will to hers. \u201cDie!\u201d\nTheir technique tore apart the Phoenix from the inside out.\nTwo Dreadgods died at the same time.\nLeaving only one.\nMost of the Phoenix\u2019s body sloughed away, revealing a starless night sky. Lindon looked up into it. \u201cI don\u2019t feel too bad,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening, Dross?\u201d\n[It\u2019s morning, Lindon,] Dross said.\nIt took him a moment to realize what that meant. All the Dreadgods warped the sky above them. Even him.\nHe turned to Yerin, feeling his body changing.\nBut she faded too. All he saw was darkness, as though the sky had swallowed him up.\nLindon heard only silence for a while. He couldn\u2019t even hear his own thoughts. He drifted, alone, in an endless void.\nEventually, he heard Dross. [He\u2019s sleeping,] Dross said.\nWho is? Lindon asked. He heard that thought, at least, echoing in the silence. Dross didn\u2019t answer him.\n[Not long. Get him to the labyrinth. He\u2019ll be fine, as long as there are no Monarchs on Cradle. \u2026I said, no Monarchs. Get going! Shoo! The sooner you\u2019re gone, the sooner he\u2019ll\u2014yes, I\u2019ll tell him. Okay. You can\u2019t really stab me, you know. Oh, you can? Then I really will tell him. I was lying before.]\nEven in a state where he felt distant from his own thoughts, Lindon could tell what was happening. Dross was telling the others what to do with him.\nHe looked down at himself, but he couldn\u2019t see his own body.\nThere was only one thing he could see: a small blue candle-flame locked inside a transparent ball of glass. A marble. It floated in the darkness, where it would be if he were holding it in his left hand.\nAs it always had, the steady flame calmed him. He watched it, drifting in his own mind.\nLindon had no idea how much time passed before he woke up.\nWhen he did, he sat upright. There were sheets tangled around his waist, but the mattress was soft as a cloud. Purple trees blew on the breeze outside the window of a simple, but richly furnished room. He smelled fresh timber, and he felt\u2026bandages. His entire body was covered in bandages.\nLindon wasn\u2019t in the labyrinth, though he could feel it nearby.

It was not only bandaged completely, so not a bit of flesh remained exposed, but had been bound in so many scripted halfsilver rings that it looked like he was wearing one armored sleeve.\nLindon felt someone approaching just before his door was rudely pushed open. Orthos, in his weathered, gray-haired human form, carried a tray packed with food. Trunks floated on wind aura behind him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re up,\u201d Orthos rumbled. \u201cGood. Tell her to transform back so she can help.\u201d\nLittle Blue was curled up on the tray, six inches high again, and she peeped her indignation.\nOrthos blew a mouthful of smoke at her. \u201cI did tell you, and you didn\u2019t listen to me. If you were tall again, you\u2019d have to work.\u201d\nLittle Blue nodded cheerily.\nThey weren\u2019t reacting like Lindon had expected. \u201cHow long was I out?\u201d\nOrthos set the tray down. \u201cThat depends on how much you remember. We had this same conversation earlier this morning.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\n\u201cAnd several days before that.\u201d\n\u201cHow long in total?\u201d\n\u201cAbout three weeks.\u201d Orthos picked up a bun, made as though to hand it to Lindon, then changed his mind and bit into it himself. \u201cWe were all very concerned the first few times. Dross told us it wasn\u2019t anything to worry about, so we worried more. You\u2019re supposed to be up for good now, this time, so eat something.\u201d Orthos crunched into a crab leg.\nLindon looked out the window. \u201cDid everyone\u2026make it?\u201d\n\u201cIf they\u2019d stuck around any longer, you wouldn\u2019t have. But yes, I saw them off myself. They went into that blue river that takes you to the heavens. Left all sorts of messages for you, but it\u2019s Dross\u2019 job to give them to you.\u201d\n\u201cHow long do I have to wait?\u201d Lindon asked.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll find out together,\u201d Orthos said.", "c2da8b50-01cb-478a-b2a6-5a4f222f6fc1": "30\n\n\n\n\n\nYerin\u2019s ascension didn\u2019t go as smoothly as Fury\u2019s had.\nIt wasn\u2019t so hard to cut a hole in the Way. In fact, she thought she\u2019d done it easier than Fury. One slash of her Goldsign and she cut deeper than space, into whatever lay beyond.\nBut, at first, she didn\u2019t see another world.\nThe swirling blue edges of the portal she\u2019d cut led onto a deep darkness that brought to mind a very strange night sky. Inside the black fabric were something like stars of every color, though they buzzed and twitched like living insects.\n\u201cDo we go in?\u201d Mercy asked uncertainly.\nZiel took a step back. \u201cI\u2019m not going in there.\u201d\nYerin agreed with Ziel. This felt wrong to her, like absence and chaos. Then again, Lindon had felt like that ever since his connection to the Void Icon. Maybe this only felt wrong because she wasn\u2019t used to it.\nShe started to move forward, but the blue edges of the portal surged. Blue light flickered between her and the empty world beyond, a film stretching across the portal entrance. The view fuzzed like a dream-aura illusion, and then she could see another world.\nThis one seemed right. It resembled the same place Fury had entered\u2014there was a cage across the sky, a courtyard nearby with shining pillars, and several banners bearing the animated image of a fox.\nA helmeted figure in white armor hovered over them, and when he saw them, he beckoned frantically. \u201cHurry! Do it n\u2014\u201d\nAbruptly, the view of the other world snapped back to the chaotic void.\nSweat beaded on Yerin\u2019s forehead. Even now, she could feel Lindon struggling with the hunger in his spirit. \u201cBleed me if I\u2019m staying here another second.\u201d\nShe was considering taking a step into this vast darkness, but Emriss put a hand on her shoulder.\n\u201cNot here,\u201d the ancient Monarch said softly. \u201cLook.\u201d\nShe didn\u2019t need to point. Yerin understood what she meant.\nOne of the closer \u2018stars,\u2019 a large point of green light, was drifting closer. As it did, Yerin could make it out more clearly.\nIt wasn\u2019t a star, or a planet, though it glowed. It was a kind of worm. Or a grub. Perhaps millions of them, joined together.\nAnd it was squirming toward them. As Yerin gazed over it, a slash in its featureless head opened, forming a sticky mouth that looked to be made of green wax.\nThe worm must be unimaginably distant still, for Yerin\u2019s Monarch eyesight to be unable to pick out more details. Even so, Yerin backed up.\nThat was not something that should exist.\nThe Death Icon whispered a soft song to her, agreeing. That creature deserved to be removed from the universe.\nWhen the portal snapped back to the actual world with the Abidan guarding it, the transition was jarring. Yerin felt herself wrong-footed by the sudden shift from chaos to order.\nThe man in the white helmet stood just in front of their portal now. \u201cDon\u2019t waste another second!\u201d he snapped.\nYerin thought she recognized that voice.\nThe entire group pushed through the gateway, which was somehow harder than crossing any other portal she\u2019d ever used. Maybe \u2018harder\u2019 wasn\u2019t right, but there was certainly more resistance. Though it only took a few steps, it was like hiking uphill. Or maybe pushing into a thick swamp.\nEmriss led, bracing her steps with her diamond-headed staff. Sha Miara followed her, still sheathed in rainbow light, sticking closer to the older Monarch. Yerin went next, followed by Ziel and Mercy.\nThe brief time seemed to stretch in Yerin\u2019s mind, the spatial tunnel trembling around her. It flickered on the edge of existence, like a candle-flame in a high wind.\nShe shoved the rest of the way through and found herself stumbling to a halt next to Emriss and Sha Miara. Ziel and Mercy still struggled, not all the way through yet.\nFrom this end, Yerin could see that something had gone terribly wrong with her portal.\nMercy and Ziel moved slowly, as though drifting through a dream, but they were twisted and distorted.

Our connection to Sector Eleven is so unstable I\u2019m surprised even you made it through.\u201d\nYerin continued to breathe deliberately as she calmed herself down. What was she doing listening to an Abidan lackey in the first place?\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get Eithan to fix it,\u201d she said to Ziel.\nKiuran snorted. \u201cThere would be nothing to fix if you hadn\u2019t dragged your feet.

If they weren\u2019t doing it, that meant they didn\u2019t care.\n\u201cIn ordinary times, it would be the work of a thought to see more of your world than you\u2019ve ever imagined. But, if you would open your own eyes, you would see that these times are not ordinary.\u201d\nYerin didn\u2019t know what this world usually looked like, but compared to what she\u2019d glimpsed through Fury\u2019s ascension, the place had seen better days.\nChunks of debris hung in the sky beyond the iron cage like a boulder had exploded above the clouds. Some of the bars that surrounded the world had been twisted or broken, buildings had collapsed and stayed where they lay, and one of the glowing pillars in this courtyard flickered.\nMore significantly, at least to Yerin, was that Kiuran was the only white-armored figure in sight.\n\u201cThis world is called Threshold,\u201d the Abidan went on, once he saw Yerin take a glance around. \u201cWe redirect all mortal ascensions here, so that they may get used to life beyond their own limited worlds.

She needed to talk to the person who knew everything.\n\u201cYell for Eithan,\u201d Yerin said.\nThe Hound gave her a look of exaggerated pity. \u201cOzriel would not come here for you, even if I were to call him. He has greater duties than this.\u201d\nYerin took a deep breath and gathered everything she had.\n\u201cEithan,\u201d she called, and even this strange world resonated with the name.\nKiuran\u2019s eyes widened. He snapped armored fingers, and her shout cut off as though she\u2019d never made it. His voice was shaky when he spoke, and he didn\u2019t seem quite so arrogant as before.\n\u201cYou must listen to me. Never try that again. The worst-case scenario for you is attracting Ozriel\u2019s attention.\u201d\nYerin was about to shout again, but she found a seal stopping her voice.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what face he showed when he walked among you,\u201d Kiuran went on. \u201cBut it was only a mask. Do you understand? You are quite literally calling for Death.\u201d\nWhen Yerin tried to respond, there was still a seal on her voice. She could feel it, a simple working that nonetheless had great depth. He had twisted the Way to block her words, and now it was as though she had never been able to speak.\nYerin pushed against it with her will, but the seal held strong.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll leave that in place for now,\u201d Kiuran said.\nFinally, with much more effort than she\u2019d expected, Yerin snapped the seal. \u201cBleed me, you try that one more time and you\u2019re not going to like what happens.\u201d\nKiuran looked surprised for a moment, but then he sneered. \u201cI am only a one-star Titan. My skill is as a Hound. Do not start a fight with an opponent you don\u2019t understand.\u201d\nMercy pointed to something behind him, but the Abidan gave her no attention.\n\u201cThat\u2019s some sharp advice,\u201d Yerin said. \u201cYou should take it.\u201d\nKiuran snorted and spread one arm. \u201cVery well. It\u2019s not unusual that a Monarch from Cradle needs a lesson in humility.\u201d\nAbruptly, the world constricted around Yerin. It felt like an impossibly heavy spiritual pressure, but also like an intense gaze piercing her through. A purple eye formed over Kiuran\u2019s head, and she was sure it knew her past, her present, her future. It broke her down to the smallest piece and weighed her.\nYerin released her Goldsigns and cycled her madra, resisting. It was still heavy, but easier than she\u2019d expected, especially when she felt the Death Icon supporting her.\nKiuran gave her a crooked smile. \u201cYou may take the first move. There is nothing about you I do not know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d contend you don\u2019t know my friends.\u201d\nThe Hound gave a skeptical glance to the others at her side, but none of them were likely to move.\nWhich was fine, because Yerin hadn\u2019t been talking about them.\nA man slipped one black-armored hand over Kiuran\u2019s shoulder. His white hair still looked strange to Yerin, but his friendly grin was too familiar.\n\u201cThank you for taking such good care of my adopted daughter,\u201d Ozriel said.\nThe pressure from the Hound disappeared as he dropped to one knee.", "5f4a2576-1db4-40b9-83a8-498da746483b": "It broke her down to the smallest piece and weighed her.\nYerin released her Goldsigns and cycled her madra, resisting.

It felt ridiculous to admit, even to herself, but she had been worried about him.\nStupid to worry about somebody who could wipe out stars, but the last that she\u2019d seen him, he\u2019d been dragged away by others on his level. It was hard not to worry.\nAnd now that he was here, he would know what to do.\nEithan\u2019s grin was keeping Kiuran nailed to the floor. \u201cI\u2019m flattered by the respect you had for my time. You\u2019ve been so vigilant in making sure I\u2019m not disturbed.\u201d\n\u201cI do apologize, Judge. I was afraid to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWise of you,\u201d Eithan interrupted. \u201cThank you for your assistance, Kiuran. I\u2019ll take it from here.\u201d\nKiuran didn\u2019t just run away. The rat-faced Abidan dove through a blue slice of space in an instant.\nEithan didn\u2019t spare him another glance, looking over the rest of them fondly. \u201cWell. You\u2019ve worked hard to be here, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d Mercy asked him.\nEithan put a hand to his chest. \u201cI have missed you all. Nobody here worries about me.\u201d\nYerin watched him closely. He was acting the same as usual, but something about this felt wrong to her. For one thing, this was a little too usual. The last they\u2019d seen him, he was being carted off like a criminal. And he surely knew what had happened in Cradle. Eithan knew everything. Still, he was behaving like they were picking up after no time apart.\nAlso, the impression of death around him was strange. Like he\u2019d recently come back from the brink.\n\u201cWhy are you looking so weak?\u201d Yerin finally asked.\nEmriss glanced to the side, giving Yerin an astonished look.\n\u201cThat is a wonderful Icon you\u2019ve found there, Yerin,\u201d Eithan said fondly. \u201cI have quite the connection to it myself. Yes, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not in my peak condition. A recent brush with death. The heavens are not quite\u2026in order, at the moment. I\u2019m somewhat surprised you made it here at all.\u201d\nYerin swallowed hard. As bad as the world around her looked, she had no context for it. Maybe the world called Threshold always seemed like it was on the edge of falling to pieces.\nBut if Eithan said the situation was bad\u2026\n\u201cAnd you brought friends!\u201d Eithan continued, turning to the other two Monarchs.\nSha Miara had fallen to her knees upon catching sight of Eithan, and now appeared as a lump of rainbow madra trembling in terror. Emriss, meanwhile, merely dipped her head, the leaves in her hair swaying.\n\u201cIt is an honor to formally meet you, Judge,\u201d she said.\nEithan gave her a softer, more distant, somehow older smile than he had given his students. \u201cThe honor is mine, truly. You are one of the few Monarchs in the history of Cradle whom I respect, and you have my support in whatever you choose to do with the rest of your life. Not that my favor is worth what it once was, but I have a few friends left. You would make a fine Phoenix.\u201d\nThe bark-like patterns on Emriss\u2019 skin wrinkled as she smiled. \u201cFor now, I would like a place to settle my family.\u201d She patted a gemstone hanging from her neck, which felt to Yerin like a very deep void key.\nEithan\u2019s smile brightened. \u201cBringing family along, even on a forced ascension! Your foresight is truly to be admired.\u201d\nHesitantly, Sha Miara lifted her head.", "b0437c9e-6cc1-477a-ad37-0f61ff922114": "Eithan gave her a softer, more distant, somehow older smile than he had given his students. \u201cThe honor is mine, truly.

It\u2019s the least I can do for my old friend from the Uncrowned King tournament!\u201d\nSha Miara\u2019s back stiffened, and Yerin suspected the young Monarch had been hoping Eithan wouldn\u2019t bring that up.\nBut that was the last thought Yerin could spare for people she didn\u2019t care about. She was about to ask a real question, but Ziel beat her to it.\n\u201cCan you help Lindon?\u201d Ziel asked.\nEithan put a finger to the side of his temple. \u201cHe had too much of a connection to hunger, so he has to stay behind until he can shake it. I haven\u2019t had the chance to check in on him recently, but that\u2019s the direction he was heading. Am I close?\u201d\n\u201cYour friend says Lindon won\u2019t make it out of Cradle,\u201d Yerin said. Eithan didn\u2019t seem concerned, but she still trembled awaiting his answer.\nEithan winked. \u201cBad news there: Cradle no longer has a stable enough connection that we can pull him out. If he does ascend, he\u2019ll find himself in great danger.\u201d\nThey all stared at him.\n\u201cWhy did you wink?\u201d Ziel asked.\nMercy pointed at Eithan. \u201cYou winked! Doesn\u2019t that mean you have good news?\u201d\n\u201cThe good news is that you can help!\u201d Eithan said happily. \u201cIf we can recover enough territory and re-establish control over enough of the Way before Lindon ascends, he\u2019ll show up right in our loving arms!\u201d\nYerin felt a sort of fond irritation. \u201cSo if we switch up the words and say the same thing, then if we don\u2019t do all this connecting in time, Lindon\u2019s going to toss himself onto a sword. True?\u201d\n\u201cWell said!\u201d Eithan said happily. \u201cI have missed our unspoken rapport.\u201d\nZiel gave a heavy sigh.\n\u201cWhat can we do to help?\u201d Mercy asked."}
